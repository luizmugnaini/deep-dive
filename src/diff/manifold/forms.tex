Throughout this section, all manifolds are assumed to be Hausdorff.

\begin{definition}[Vector field]
\label{def:vector-field}
A vector field on a manifold \(X\) is defined as a map \(f: X \to E\) assigning
every point \(p \in X\) to a vector of the Banach space \(E\).
\end{definition}

A functor of interest to us will be one that assigns, to each pair of Banach
spaces, the collection of \(r\)-multilinear alternating maps from one space to
the other, we shall call it
\[
  L_{\Alt}^r: \Ban \times \Ban \to L_{\Alt}^r(\Ban, \Ban),
\]
mapping \((E, F) \mapsto L_{\Alt}^r(E, F)\) \todo{what about the morphisms?}.
Notice that \(L_{\Alt}^r\) is a bifunctor which is contravariant in the first
variable, and covariant for the second.

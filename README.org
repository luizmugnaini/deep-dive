# Deep Dive

This is just a poetic name to a compilation of notes that I'm writing while
studying mathematics. They currently encompass:

* Category Theory
* Linear Algebra
* Group Theory
* Topology
* Graph Theory

None of these subjects are completed (for trivial reasons). I don't know why I
keep these notes public, but if you happen to compile them and find them helpful
or stupid in some way (and if you're willing to help), reach me out and I'll be
quite happy to have some feedback.

For the compilation of the notes:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/luizmugnaini/algebra
$ cd deep-dive
$ latexmk -pvc
```

\section{Simplex Category}

\subsection{Construction}

\begin{definition}[Skeletal simplex category]
    \label{def:skeletal-simplex-category}
    We denote by \(\Splx\) the category whose objects are natural numbers
    \([n] \coloneq \{0 \leq 1 \leq \dots \leq n\}\), and whose morphisms
    \(\phi: [n] \to [m]\) are order-preserving---that is, if \(i \leq j\) then
    \(\phi(i) \leq \phi(j)\). The category \(\Splx\) is called the \emph{skeletal
        simplex category}.

    Along with the simplex category comes distinguished morphisms:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item For each \(0 \leq j \leq n\), we denote by
              \(\delta_j^n: [n - 1] \mono [n]\) the order-preserving \emph{injective}
              morphism skipping the \(j\)-th value:
              \[
                  \delta_j^n(i) \coloneq
                  \begin{cases}
                      i,     & \text{if } i < j, \\
                      i + 1, & i \geq j.
                  \end{cases}
              \]
              This morphism is called \emph{elementary faces}.

        \item For each \(0 \leq j \leq n\), we denote by
              \(\sigma_j^n: [n + 1] \epi [n]\) the \emph{surjective} morphism repeating the
              \(j\)-th value twice and every other value only once:
              \[
                  \sigma_j^n(i) \coloneq
                  \begin{cases}
                      i,     & \text{if } i \leq j, \\
                      i - 1, & \text{if } i > j.
                  \end{cases}
              \]
              This morphism is called \emph{elementary degeneracies}.
    \end{itemize}
    When convenient, we may drop the superscript of these maps and simply refer to
    them as \(\delta_i\) and \(\sigma_j\).
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}[Morphisms in \(\Splx\)]
    \label{not:simplex-morphisms}
    When convenient, a morphism \(f: [n] \to [m]\) in \(\Splx\) shall be explicitly
    denoted by
    \[
        f \coloneq \langle f_0 f_1 \dots f_n \rangle
    \]
    where \(f_j \coloneq f j \in [m]\) for each \(0 \leq j \leq n\). Moreover these
    maps can also be refered to as \emph{simplicial operators}.
\end{notation}

\begin{lemma}[Generating morphisms in \(\Splx\)]
    \label{lem:elementary-maps-generate-simplex-maps}
    Every morphism of \(\Splx\) can be generated by a composition of elementary
    faces and degeneracies.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(f: [n] \to [m]\) be any morphism of \(\Splx\). We can factor \(f\) through
    an injection \(\iota: [n] \mono [k]\) and a surjection \(s: [k] \epi [m]\):
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {[n]} \ar[rr, "f"] \ar[dr, two heads, "s"'] &&{[m]} \\
            &{[k]} \ar[ru, tail, "\iota"'] &
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    where \(k \coloneq |\im f|\). Since \(s\) and \(\iota\) must be order-preserving
    maps, it follows that they can be written as a finite composition of elementary
    degeneracies and elementary faces.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    \label{cor:mono-and-epi-in-Splx-are-split-mono-and-epi}
    Every monomorphism of \(\Splx\) is split (admits a retraction),
    while every epimorphism of \(\Splx\) is split (admits a section).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Given an elementary face \(\delta_j: [n] \mono [n+1]\) the elementary degeneracy
    map \(\sigma_j: [n+1] \epi [n]\) is a retract of \(\delta_j\), and \(\delta_j\)
    is a section of \(\sigma_j\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Cosimplicial identities]
    \label{cor:cosimplicial-identities}
    Fix any \(n \in \N\) and consider indices \(0 \leq i, j \leq n\). The following
    identities correlate elementary faces and degeneracies:
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item If \(i < j\) then
              \(\delta_j^n \delta_i^{n-1} = \delta_i^n \delta_{j-1}^{n-1}\).

        \item If \(i < j\) then
              \(\sigma_i^{n-1} \sigma_j^n = \sigma_{j-1}^{n-1} \sigma_i^n \).

        \item If \(i < j\) then
              \(\sigma_i^{n-1} \delta_j^n = \delta_{j-1}^{n-1} \sigma_i^{n-2}\).

        \item If \(i = j - 1\) or \(i = j\), then \(\sigma_i^n \delta_j^{n+1} = \Id_n\).

        \item If \(i > j\) then
              \(\sigma_i^{n-1} \delta_j^n = \delta_j^{n-1} \sigma_{i-1}^{n-2}\).
    \end{enumerate}
    These identities can be found in the following four commutative diagrams:
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {[n-2]} \ar[r, "\delta_i^{n-1}"] \ar[d, "\delta_{j-1}^{n-1}"']
            &{[n-1]} \ar[d, "\delta_j^n"] \\
            {[n-1]} \ar[r, "\delta_i^n"'] &{[n]}
        \end{tikzcd}
        \qquad
        \qquad
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {[n+1]} \ar[r, "\sigma_j^n"] \ar[d, "\sigma_i^n"']
            &{[n]} \ar[d, "\sigma_i^{n-1}"] \\
            {[n]} \ar[r, "\sigma_{j-1}^{n-1}"'] &{[n-1]}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {[n - 1]} \ar[r, "\delta_j^n"] \ar[d, "\sigma_i^{n-2}"']
            &{[n]} \ar[d, "\sigma_i^{n-1}"] \\
            {[n-2]} \ar[r, "\delta_{j-1}^{n-1}"'] &{[n-1]}
        \end{tikzcd}
        \qquad
        \qquad
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {[n - 1]} \ar[r, "\delta_j^n"] \ar[d, "\sigma_{i-1}^{n-2}"']
            &{[n]} \ar[d, "\sigma_i^{n-1}"] \\
            {[n-2]} \ar[r, "\delta_j^{n-1}"'] &{[n-1]}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}[Cosimplicial object]
    \label{def:cosimp-obj}
    Given a category \(\cat C\), we define a \emph{cosimplicial object} in
    \(\cat C\) to be a covariant functor
    \[
        F: \Splx \longrightarrow \cat C.
    \]
    Any cosimplicial object \(F\) is completely determined by \(F [n]\) for all
    \(n \in \N\) and by the maps \(F \delta_i\) and \(F \sigma_j\). The collection
    of all cosimplicial objects of \(\cat C\) will be denoted by
    \(\CoSimp{\cat C}\).
\end{definition}

\subsection{Limits \& Colimits in \texorpdfstring{\(\Splx\)}{Delta}}

\begin{lemma}[Pushout of injections]
    \label{lem:splx-cat-pushout-injections}
    Let \(\iota: [k] \emb [n]\) and \(\tau: [k] \emb [m]\) be order-preserving
    inclusions where
    \[
        \iota(j) \coloneq j\ \text{ and }\ \tau(j) \coloneq j + (m - k),
    \]
    that is, \(\iota\) sends \([k]\) to the initial segment of \([n]\), while
    \(\tau\) sends \([k]\) to the terminal segment of \([m]\). There exists a
    pushout
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {[k]} \ar[r, hook, "\iota"] \ar[d, hook, "\tau"']
            \ar[rd, "\ulcorner", very near end, phantom]
            &{[n]} \ar[d] \\
            {[m]} \ar[r] &{[n] \cup_{[k]} [m]}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    in the simplex category \(\Splx\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Indeed, if we consider \([m + n - k]\) as a candidate for the pushout, notice
    that the following diagram commutes
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {[k]} \ar[r, hook, "\iota"] \ar[d, hook, "\tau"']
            &{[n]} \ar[d, "\tau"] \\
            {[m]} \ar[r, "\iota"'] &{[m + n - k]}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    Now, consider any object \([\ell] \in \Splx\) together with two morphisms
    \(f: [n] \to [\ell]\) and \(g: [m] \to [\ell]\) such that \(f \iota = g
    \tau\). Define a map \(\phi: [m + n - k] \to [\ell]\) as follows
    \[
        \phi(j) \coloneq
        \begin{cases}
            g(j),                  & \text{if } j \leq m - k,            \\
            g(j) = f(j - (m - k)), & \text{if } m - k \leq j \leq m,     \\
            f(j - (m - k)),        & \text{if } m \leq j \leq m + n - k.
        \end{cases}
    \]
    It is easy to see that \(\phi\) is an order-preserving map and is uniquely
    defined so that the following diagram commutes
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {[k]} \ar[r, hook, "\iota"] \ar[d, hook, "\tau"']
            &{[n]} \ar[d, "\tau"] \ar[drd, bend left, "f"] & \\
            {[m]} \ar[r, "\iota"'] \ar[rrd, bend right, "g"']
            &{[m + n - k]} \ar[rd, dashed, "\phi"] & \\
            & &{[\ell]}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    Therefore \([m + n - k] = [n] \cup_{[k]} [m]\) since we are in a skeletal
    category and isomorphism classes contain a unique representative.
\end{proof}

These pushouts lead to an interesting construction, any object \([n] \in \Splx\)
is the colimit of a diagram consisting of \([0]\)'s and \([1]\)'s, since
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        {[0]} \ar[r, hook, "0"]
        \ar[d, hook, "m"'] \ar[rd, phantom, very near end, "\ulcorner"]
        &{[n]} \ar[d] \\
        {[m]} \ar[r] &{[m + n]}
    \end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{lemma}[Pushout of surjections]
    \label{lem:splx-cat-pushout-surjections}
    The following properties concern the pushout of pairs of surjective morphisms in
    \(\Splx\):
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item Considering the cosimplicial identity (2) (see
              \cref{cor:cosimplicial-identities}), where \(i < j\), there exists
              \emph{sections} \(\alpha: [n] \to [n+1]\) of \(\sigma_i^n\), and
              \(\beta: [n-1] \to [n]\) of \(\sigma_i^{n-1}\) such that the following diagram
              commutes
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[n+1]} \ar[rr, "\sigma_j^n"] \ar[dd, bend left, "\sigma_i^n"]
                      &&{[n]} \ar[dd, bend right, "\sigma_i^{n-1}"'] \\ & &\\
                      {[n]} \ar[uu, bend left, "\alpha"] \ar[rr, "\sigma_{j-1}^{n-1}"']
                      &&{[n-1]} \ar[uu, bend right, "\beta"']
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              that is, \(\sigma_j^n \alpha = \beta \sigma_{j-1}^{n-1}\) --- these sections
              are said to be \emph{compatible} with the square. Therefore, the square is an
              \emph{absolute pushout}.
        \item Let \(p: [n] \epi [k]\) and \(q: [n] \epi [\ell]\) be \emph{surjections}
              in \(\Splx\). Then the \emph{pushout} of \(p\) and \(q\) exists and is
              \emph{absolute}:
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[n]} \ar[r, two heads, "q"]
                      \ar[d, two heads, "p"']
                      \ar[rd, very near end, phantom, "\ulcorner"]
                      &{[\ell]} \ar[d] \\
                      {[k]} \ar[r] &{[m]}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    For the proof of item (a), proceed as follows. From the cosimplicial identity
    (3) we have \(\delta_i^{n+1} \sigma_i^n = \sigma_i^{n+1} \delta_{i+1}^{n+2}\),
    moreover, from (4) we obtain \(\sigma_i^{n+1} \delta_{i+1}^{n+2} = \Id_{n+1}\)
    --- thus \(\delta_i^{n+1}\) is a section of \(\sigma_i^n\). Analogously, we find
    that \(\delta_i^n\) is a section of \(\sigma_i^{n-1}\). For the
    compatibility condition, notice that since \(i < j\), then from (5) we know that
    \(\sigma_j^n \delta_i^{n+1} = \delta_i^n \sigma_{j-1}^{n-1}\). Therefore we may
    define \(\alpha \coloneq \delta_i^{n+1}\) and \(\beta \coloneq \delta_i^n\).

    For item (b), since surjections are finite compositions of degeneracies, via
    item (a) and \cref{prop:absolute-pushout}, we conclude that the square in (b) is
    an absolute pushout.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:splx-cat-pullback-mono-pushout-epi}
    The following are properties of pullbacks along monomorphisms and pushouts along
    epimorphisms in the simplex category \(\Splx\):
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item If \(f: [m] \mono [n]\) is a \emph{monomorphism}, then if \(g: [k] \to
              [n]\) is any morphism such that \(\im g \cap \im f \neq \emptyset\), then the
              square
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[a]}  \ar[r] \ar[d] \ar[rd, phantom, very near start, "\lrcorner"]
                      &{[k]} \ar[d, "g"] \\
                      {[m]} \ar[r, tail, "f"'] &{[n]}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              is a \emph{pullback} in \(\Splx\).
        \item If \(f: [m] \epi [n]\) is an \emph{epimorphism}, then for any morphism
              \(g: [m] \to [k]\), then square
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[m]} \ar[r, two heads, "f"] \ar[d, "g"']
                      \ar[dr, very near end, phantom, "\ulcorner"]
                      &{[n]} \ar[d] \\
                      {[k]} \ar[r] &{[b]}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              is a \emph{pushout} in \(\Splx\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

% \begin{proof}
% For item (a), since \(\im g \cap \im f \neq \emptyset\), then the preimage
% \(g^{-1}(\im f) \subseteq [k]\) is a non-empty set

% For item (b), since \(f\) is a surjection, it can be decomposed into
% degeneracies. Thus it is sufficient to prove the proposition for an elementary
% degeneracy \(\sigma_j: [m] \to [m-1]\). The pushout of the pair \((\sigma_j,
% g)\) is given by a map
% \end{proof}

    book is a bit mysterious}

\section{Simplicial Sets}

\subsection{Construction}

\begin{definition}[Simplicial object]
    \label{def:simplicial-object}
    For any category \(\cat C\), a \emph{simplicial object} in \(\cat C\) is a
    contravariant functor \(\Splx^{\op} \to \cat C\). We define \(\Simp{\cat C}\) to
    be the category whose objects are simplicial objects and natural transformations
    between them---such category is commonly referred to as the \emph{simplicial
        category of \(\cat C\)}.
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}[Unwrapping the definition]
    \label{not:unwrapping-the-definition}
    Less compactly, a simplicial object \(X \in \Simp{\cat C}\) consists of a
    collection of objects \((X_n)_{n \in \N}\), for
    \(X_n \coloneq X [n] \in \cat C\), and arrows \(\alpha^{*}: X_n \to X_m\) in
    \(\cat C\) for each map \(\alpha: [m] \to [n]\) in \(\Splx\). The nature of
    these arrows are as discussed in \cref{rem:yoneda-f*-notation}.
\end{notation}

\begin{notation}[Simplicial sets, notations and nomenclatures]
    \label{not:simplicial-sets-notation-and-nomenclature}
    In particular, the most important case we'll study for the time being is the
    \emph{simplicial category of sets}, which we denote by \(\sSet\). The objects of
    \(\sSet\) shall be called \emph{simplicial sets}.\

    Given a simplicial set \(X \in \sSet\), the points of \(X_n \in \Set\) will be
    referred to as the \emph{\(n\)-cells} (or \emph{\(n\)-simplices}) of
    \(X \in \sSet\).
\end{notation}

Since every map \(\alpha\) in \(\Splx\) may be decomposed into elementary face
and degeneracies, the the collection \(\delta_i^{*}\) and \(\sigma_j^{*}\) also
generate the morphisms \(\alpha^{*}\) between the objects of
\((X_n)_{n \in \N}\) of \(\cat C\). In the context of the simplicial category,
we denote them by
\begin{align*}
    d_i^n & \coloneq (\delta_i^n)^{*}: X_n \longrightarrow X_{n-1}, \\
    s_j^n & \coloneq (\sigma_j^n)^{*}: X_n \longrightarrow X_{n+1},
\end{align*}
for all \(0 \leq i, j \leq n\). The arrows \(d_i\) are called \emph{face maps}
(or \emph{cofaces}), while the arrows \(s_j\) are called \emph{degeneracy maps}
(or \emph{codegeneracies}) of the simplicial object \(X\).

A map \(\eta: X \nat Y\) is a natural transformation between simplicial objects
if and only if it is compatible with the face and degeneracy maps, that is, the
following two diagrams commute in \(\cat C\) for all \(n \in \N\),
\(0 \leq i, j\leq n\):
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        X_n \ar[r, "\eta_n"] \ar[d, "d_i^n"'] &Y_n \ar[d, "d_i^n"] \\
        X_{n-1} \ar[r, "\eta_{n-1}"'] &Y_{n-1}
    \end{tikzcd}
    \qquad
    \qquad
    \begin{tikzcd}
        X_n \ar[r, "\eta_n"] \ar[d, "s_j^n"'] &Y_n \ar[d, "s_j^n"] \\
        X_{n+1} \ar[r, "\eta_{n+1}"'] &Y_{n+1}
    \end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{corollary}[Simplicial identities]
    \label{cor:simplicial-identities}
    Since the face and degeneracy maps \(d_i\) and \(s_j\) are \emph{dual} to the
    elementary face and degeneracy maps \(\delta_i\) and \(\sigma_j\), they satisfy
    the following identities---which are dual to \cref{cor:cosimplicial-identities}:
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item \(d_i d_j = d_{j-1} d_i\), for \(i < j\).
        \item \(s_j s_i = s_i s_{j-1}\), for \(i < j\).
        \item \(d_j s_i = s_i d_{j-1}\), for \(i < j-1\).
        \item \(d_j s_i = \Id\), if \(i = j\) or \(i = j-1\).
        \item \(d_j s_i = s_{i-1} d_j\), for \(i > j\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

\subsubsection{Subcomplexes}

\begin{definition}[Subcomplex]
    \label{def:subcomplex}
    By a \emph{subcomplex} of a simplicial set we mean a subobject.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:image-is-subcomplex}
    Given a morphism of simplicial sets \(f: X \to Y\), the image \(f X\) is a
    subcomplex of \(Y\).
\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Discrete Simplicial Sets}

\begin{definition}[Discrete simplicial set]
    \label{def:discrete-simplicial-set}
    We say that a simplicial set \(X\) is \emph{discrete} if every simplicial
    operator \(f: [m] \to [n]\) induces a \emph{bijective set-function}
    \(f^{*}: X_n \to X_m\). We denote by \(\sSet^{\disc}\) the full subcategory of
    \(\sSet\) consisting of discrete simplicial sets.

    For every set \(S\), there exists a discrete simplicial set \(S^{\disc}\) where
    \(S_n^{\disc} \coloneq S\) for each \(n \in \N\), and for any \(f: [n] \to [m]\)
    we have \(S^{\disc} f \coloneq \Id_S\).
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
    \label{cor:bijection-discrete-simplicial-set-and-set-functions}
    For any set \(S\) and simplicial set \(X\), there exists a bijection
    \[
        \Hom_{\sSet}(S^{\disc}, X) \iso \Hom_{\Set}(S, X_0).
    \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Define a set-function
    \(\Phi: \Hom_{\sSet}(S^{\disc}, X) \to \Hom_{\Set}(S, X_0)\) by mapping each
    simplicial set morphism \(f: S^{\disc} \to X\) to the corresponding set function
    \(f_0: S \to X_0\). To prove that \(\Phi\) is injective, consider simplicial
    morphisms \(f, g: S^{\disc} \para X\) such that \(f_0 = g_0\). Applying the
    naturallity of \(f\) and \(g\) to the simplicial operator \(j: [n] \to [0]\) we
    obtain that \(j^{*} f_0 = f_n\) and \(j^{*} g_0 = g_n\), but since
    \(f_0 = f_0\), then \(f_n = g_n\)---proving that \(f = g\). Surjectivity is
    immediate, therefore \(\Phi\) is a bijection.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[\(\sSet^{\disc}\) \& \(\Set\)]
    \label{prop:sSet-disc-equivalent-to-Set}
    The full subcategory of discrete simplicial sets is \emph{equivalent} to the
    category of sets.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We start by constructing a functor \(\disc: \Set \to \sSet^{\disc}\) where we
    define the simplicial set \(S^{\disc}\) associated with a given set \(S\) to be
    the simplicial set with \(S_n^{\disc} = S\) for every \(S\). Each set-function
    \(f: A \to B\) is mapped to their corresponding simplicial set morphism
    \(f: A^{\disc} \to B^{\disc}\) given by \(f_n \coloneq f: A \to B\) for each
    \(n \in \N\). We now show that \(\disc\) is an equivalence of categories:

    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item (Fully faithful) Given any two sets, \(S\) and \(T\), define a
              set-function
              \(\Phi: \Mor_{\Set}(S, T) \to \Mor_{\sSet^{\disc}}(S^{\disc}, T^{\disc})\) by
              mapping each set function \(f: S \to T\) to \(f: S^{\disc} \to T^{\disc}\) as
              above. Then it's clear that \(\Phi\) is a \emph{bijection}.

        \item (Essentially surjective) Given any \(X \in \sSet^{\disc}\), consider the
              set \(S \coloneq X_0\)---we'll show that \(X \iso S^{\disc}\). Define a
              morphism of simplicial sets \(f: S^{\disc} \to X\) where \(f_0 \coloneq
              \Id_{X_0}\). Let \(\alpha: [n] \to [0]\) be any simplicial operator. Since
              \(\alpha^{*}: X_0 \isoto X_n\) is a bijection, then by naturality of \(f\) we
              find that
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      &X_0 \ar[dd, "\dis"', "\alpha^{*}"]
                      \\
                      S \ar[ru, "\Id_{X_0}"] \ar[rd, "f_n"'] &
                      \\
                      &X_n
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              commutes in \(\Set\), making \(f_n\) a bijection, which proves that \(f\) is a
              natural isomorphism of simplicial sets.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Standard Simplices}

\begin{definition}[Standard simplex]
    \label{def:standard-n-simplex}
    We define the \emph{standard \(n\)-simplex} \(\splx^n\) to be the contravariant
    functor \(\Splx^{\op} \to \Set\) represented by \([n]\), that is, the
    \emph{simplicial set}
    \[
        \splx^n \coloneq \Hom_{\Splx}(-, [n]).
    \]
    The \emph{generator} of the standard \(n\)-simplex corresponds to the \(n\)-cell
    \[
        \iota_n \coloneq \Id_{[n]} \in \splx^n [n].
    \]
\end{definition}

Let \(\phi: [\ell] \to [k]\) be any simplicial operator, then the action of
\(\phi\) on the cells of \(\splx^n\) is given by the map
\(\splx^n \phi = \phi^{*}: \splx^k \to \splx^{\ell}\). Explicitly, given a
\(k\)-cell \(\alpha: [k] \to [n]\) of \(\splx^n\), the action of the simplicial
operator \(\phi\) on \(\alpha\) yields an \(\ell\)-cell
\[
    \big(\phi^{*} \alpha = \alpha \phi: [\ell] \longrightarrow [n]\big)
    \in \splx^n[\ell].
\]

\begin{lemma}[Yoneda consequences]
    \label{lem:yoneda-lemma-on-Splx-category}
    Given a simplicial set \(X\), there exists a bijection
    \[
        \Hom_{\sSet}(\splx^n, X) \iso X_n,
    \]
    which is explicitly given by the map \(\eta \mapsto \eta_n
    \iota_n\). Equivalently, for each \(n\)-cell \(x \in X_n\), there \emph{exists}
    a \emph{unique} morphism of simplicial sets \(\eta^x: \splx^n \to X\) such that
    \(\eta_n^x \iota_n = x\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Consider the Yoneda functor \(\yo_{\Splx}: \Splx \to \sSet\), mapping each
    object \([n] \mapsto \splx^n\) and each simplicial operator \(f: [n] \to [m]\)
    to the morphism of simplicial sets \(f_{*}: \splx^n \to \splx^m\). Explicitly,
    for each \(k \in \N\) we have \((f_{*})_k: \splx^n[k] \to \splx^m[k]\) mapping
    \(\alpha \mapsto f \alpha\). By the Yoneda lemma we know that there exists, for
    each \(n \in \N\), a bijection
    \[
        \Hom_{\sSet}(\splx^n, X) = \Hom_{\sSet}(\yo_{\Splx}[n], X) \iso X_n.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Representing map of a cell]
    \label{def:representing-map-of-a-cell}
    Regarding \cref{lem:yoneda-lemma-on-Splx-category}, we shall refer to \(\eta^x\)
    as the \emph{representing map} of the \(n\)-cell \(x\). When convenient,
    we'll simply denote \(\eta^x\) by \(x: \splx^n \to X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
    \label{cor:bijection-mor-set-standard-simplices}
    There exists a bijection
    \[
        \Hom_{\sSet}(\splx^n, \splx^m) \iso \splx^m[n].
    \]
    The \emph{inverse} of this set-function is explicitly given by mapping each
    simplicial operator \(\alpha: [n] \to [m]\) to the corresponding morphism of
    simplicial sets \(\alpha_{*}: \splx^n \to \splx^m\)---where \(\alpha_{*}\) acts
    on any \(k\)-cell \(x \in \splx^n[k]\) as
    \(\alpha_{*} x = \alpha x \in \splx^m[k]\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    In the proof of \cref{lem:yoneda-lemma-on-Splx-category}, merely consider the
    case where \(X \coloneq \splx^m\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Standard simplices \& \(\Splx\)]
    \label{cor:standard-simplices-equivalent-Splx}
    The full subcategory \(\sSet_{\splx}\) of \(\sSet\) consisting of standard
    simplices is \emph{equivalent} to the simplex category \(\Splx\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Consider the functor \(F: \Splx \to \sSet_{\splx}\) given by
    \([n] \mapsto \splx^n\) and mapping each simplicial operator \(f: [n] \to [m]\)
    to its corresponding morphism of simplicial sets \(f_{*}: \splx^n \to
    \splx^m\). By \cref{lem:yoneda-lemma-on-Splx-category} we see that \(F\) is
    fully faithful and essentially surjective---thus an equivalence of categories.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Standard simplices on totally ordered sets]
    \label{def:standard-simplex-on-totally-ordered-set}
    Given a totally ordered set \(S\), we define the \emph{standard \(S\)-simplicial
        set} \(\splx^S\) to be the functor\footnote{We denote by \(\tOrd\) the category
        of totally ordered sets.}
    \[
        \splx^{S} \coloneq \Hom_{\tOrd}(-, S)|_{\Splx},
    \]
    that is, for each \(n \in \N\) we define \(\splx^S_n\) to be the collection of
    order preserving maps \([n] \to S\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Boundary of a standard simplex]
    \label{def:boundary-of-standard-simplex}
    For every \(n \in \N\), we define the \emph{boundary} of the standard
    \(n\)-simplex \(\splx^n\) to be the subobject
    \[
        \Bd \splx^n \coloneq \Colim_{k \in [n]} \splx^{[n] \setminus k}
        = \bigcup_{k \in [n]} \splx^{[n] \setminus k}
    \]
    composed of all \emph{codimension-one faces} of \(\splx^n\). Explicitly, for
    each \(k \in \N\) we have
    \[
        \Bd \splx^n [k] = \{ f \in \Hom_{\Splx}([k], [n]) \colon f[k] \neq [n] \}
        \subseteq \splx^n[k],
    \]
    composed of all \emph{non-surjective \(k\)-cells} of \(\splx^n\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:boundary-maximal-proper-subcomplex}
    The boundary \(\Bd \splx^n\) is the \emph{maximal proper subcomplex of
        \(\splx^n\)}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(X\) be a proper subcomplex of \(\splx^n\).
    \todo[inline]{Prove}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Geometric Realization of the Simplex Category}

We define, for each \(n \in \N\), a corresponding \emph{standard topological
    \(n\)-simplex} \(\splxtop^n\) given by
\[
    \splxtop^n \coloneq \bigg\{(t_0, \dots, t_n) \in \R^{n+1} \colon \sum_{j=0}^n
    t_j = 1 \text{ and } t_j \geq 0 \text{ for all } j \bigg\}.
\]
Each \(\splxtop^n\) is composed of \(n+1\) vertices
\(v_j \coloneq (\delta_{ij})_{i=0}^n\).

From a categorical point of view, standard topological simplices are nothing
more than a functor
\[
    \splxtop^{\bullet}: \Splx \longrightarrow \Top,
\]
mapping objects \(\splxtop^{\bullet}[n] \coloneq \splxtop^n\)---where
\(\splxtop^n\) is endowed with the standard euclidean topology---and for each
morphism \(f: [n] \to [m]\) in \(\Splx\), we map
\(\splxtop^{\bullet} f \coloneq f_{*}\), where
\(f_{*}: \splxtop^n \to \splxtop^m\) is a uniquely determined continuous map
such that \(f_{*}(v_j) \coloneq v_{f(j)}\). From this definition we obtain
\[
    f_{*}(t_0, \dots, t_n) = (s_0, \dots, s_m) \text{,\ \ where \ }
    s_j = \sum_{f(i) = j} t_i,
\]
that is, \(s_j\) is the sum of the points that are collapsed to the \(j\)-th
coordinate.

This functor gives us a geometric visualization of the action of the elementary
face and degeneracies:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Given an elementary \emph{face} map \(\delta_j: [n-1] \mono [n]\), for any
          \(0 \leq j \leq n\), the corresponding map
          \((\delta_j)_{*}: \splxtop^{n-1} \emb \splxtop^n\) is given by
          \[
              (\delta_j)_{*} v_i =
              \begin{cases}
                  v_i,     & \text{if } i < j,    \\
                  v_{i+1}, & \text{if } i \geq j.
              \end{cases}
          \]
          That is, \((\delta_j)_{*}\) embeds \(\splxtop^{n-1}\) as a face of
          \(\splxtop^n\) opposite to the \(j\)-th vertex.

    \item An elementary \emph{degeneracy} map \(\sigma_j: [n+1] \epi [n]\), for any
          \(0 \leq j \leq n\), has a map
          \((\sigma_j)_{*}: \splxtop^{n+1} \epi \splxtop^n\) mapping the vertices as
          follows
          \[
              (\sigma_j)_{*} v_i =
              \begin{cases}
                  v_i,     & \text{if } i \leq j, \\
                  v_{i-1}, & \text{if } i > j.
              \end{cases}
          \]
          Geometrically, the degeneracy map makes \(\splxtop^{n+1}\) into \(\splxtop^n\)
          by removing a face of dimension \(1\)---through the projection parallel to the
          line connecting \(v_j\) and \(v_{j+1}\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geometric Realization of a Simplicial Set}

Given a simplicial set \(X: \Splx^{\op} \to \Set\), we consider the topological
space
\[
    \coprod_{n \in \N} X_n \times \splxtop^n
\]
and construct in this space a minimal equivalence relation \(\sim_{\text{gr}}\)
for which points \((x, t) \in X_n \times \splxtop^n\) and
\((x', t') \in X_m \times \splxtop^m\) are
\emph{equivalent}---\((x, t) \sim_{\text{gr}} (x', t')\)---if and only if there
exists a morphism \(\alpha: [m] \to [n]\) in \(\Splx\) such that
\(x' = \alpha^{*} x\) and \(t = \alpha_{*} t'\). In an equivalent manner, we may
summarize this equivalence relation as gluing points of the form
\[
    (x, \alpha_{*} t) \sim_{\text{gr}} (\alpha^{*} x, t).
\]
The points of the resulting quotient space
\((\coprod_{n \in \N} X_n \times \splxtop^n)/{\sim_{\text{gr}}}\) are denoted by
\(x \otimes t\)---corresponding to the class of a pair \((x, t)\).

\todo[inline]{Study why this construction is related to a tensor product of the
    form \(X \otimes_{\Splx} \splxtop^{\bullet}\).}

\begin{definition}[Geometric realization functor]
    \label{def:geometric-realization-functor}
    We define the \emph{geometric realization} of the category of simplicial sets to
    be a functor
    \[
        |-|: \sSet \longrightarrow \Top,
    \]
    mapping
    \(|X| \coloneq (\coprod_{n \in \N} X_n \times \splxtop^n)/{\sim_{\text{gr}}}\) and
    for each natural transformation \(\eta: X \to Y\) we have a topological morphism
    \(|\eta|: |X| \to |Y|\) given by \(x \otimes t \mapsto \eta_n x \otimes t\),
    for \((x, t) \in X_n \times \splxtop^n\).

    For any simplicial set \(X\), each \(n\)-cell \(x \in X_n\) induces
    \emph{topological} morphism
    \[
        \widehat{x}: \splxtop^n \longrightarrow |X|\text{, \ mapping }\
        t \longmapsto x \otimes t.
    \]
    From construction, given a morphism \(\alpha: [n] \to [m]\) in \(\Splx\) and a
    point \(y \in X_m\) such that \(y = \alpha^{*} x\), the diagram
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:commutativity-n-simplexes}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \splxtop^m \ar[rr, "\alpha_{*}"] \ar[rd, "\widehat y"']
            & &\splxtop^n \ar[ld, "\widehat x"] \\
            &{|X|} &
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    commutes in \(\Top\).

    \todo[inline]{This looks like there exists an induced slice over category
        \(\cat C/|X|\)---where \(\cat C\) is a subcategory of \(\Top\) consisting of
        standard topological simplices and morphisms between them---whose objects are
        \(\widehat x\) and morphisms \(\phi: \widehat x \to \widehat y\) are maps
        \(\phi_{*}: \splxtop^m \to \splxtop^n\) for some \(\phi: [n] \to [m]\) in
        \(\Splx\).}
\end{definition}

Given any category \(\cat C\) and a functor \(F: \Splx \to \cat C\), we can
define a \emph{simplicial set} induced by any object \(C \in \cat C\) given by
\[
    \Hom_{\cat C}(F(-), C): \Splx^{\op} \longrightarrow \Set.
\]
This simplicial set maps each \([n] \in \Splx\) to the set of morphisms
\(\Hom_{\cat C}(F n, C)\), and each morphism \(\alpha: [m] \to [n]\) of
\(\Splx\) to the set-function
\(\alpha^{*}: \Hom_{\cat C}(F n, C) \to \Hom_{\cat C}(F m, C)\).


\begin{definition}[Singular complex]
    \label{def:singular-complex-functor}
    Let \(\cat C\) be a category and \(F: \Splx \to \cat C\) be a functor. We define
    the \emph{singular complex} of \(\cat C\) to be the functor
    \[
        \Sing_F: \cat C \longrightarrow \sSet
    \]
    mapping each object \(C \in \cat C\) to the simplicial set
    \[
        \Sing_F(C) \coloneq \Hom_{\cat C}(F(-), C): \Splx^{\op} \longrightarrow \Set,
    \]
    and each map \(\alpha: [m] \to [n]\) to the set-function
    \[
        \Sing_F(\alpha) \coloneq \alpha^{*}:
        \Hom_{\cat C}(F n, C) \longrightarrow \Hom_{\cat C}(F m, C).
    \]

    In particular, the standard topological simplices functor \(\splxtop^{\bullet}: \Splx \to
    \Top\) induces a singular complex on each topological space. Since we shall be
    mostly interested in this particular case for the time being, we shall reserve
    the notation
    \[
        \Sing \coloneq \Sing_{\splxtop^{\bullet}}: \Top \longrightarrow \sSet,
    \]
    with no subscripts, for the standard topological simplices functor. In this
    case, given a topological space \(T\), we shall denote by \(\Sing(T)_n\) the
    image of \([n] \in \Splx\) under the simplicial set \(\Sing(T)\).
\end{definition}

Given a simplicial set \(X\), the collection of simplexes
\((\widehat{x}_n)_{n \in \N}\), where \(x_n \in X_n\), covers the whole
topological space \(|X|\)---in the sense that collection of images forms a cover
of \(|X|\). Therefore, given any topological morphism \(\phi: |X| \to T\), this
map is completely defined by the family of compositions
\((\phi \widehat{x}_n: \splxtop^n \to T)_{n \in \N}\). Given a morphism
\(\alpha: [n] \to [n]\) in \(\Splx\), by \cref{eq:commutativity-n-simplexes},
the diagram
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \splxtop^m \ar[rr, "\alpha_{*}"]
        \ar[rd, "\widehat y_m"']
        \ar[drd, bend right, "\phi \widehat y_m"']
        & &\splxtop^n \ar[ld, "\widehat x_n"]
        \ar[dld, bend left, "\phi \widehat x_n"] \\
        &{|X|} \ar[d, "\phi"] & \\
        &T &
    \end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes in \(\Top\). This construction induces unique a collection of maps
\[
    (\phi_n: X_n \longrightarrow \Sing(T)_n)_{n \in \N},
\]
where \(\phi_n(x) \mapsto \phi \widehat x\). Notice that this family of arrows
is nothing more than a natural transformation \(\phi: X \nat \Sing(T)\) between
simplicial sets. From this we conclude that there exists a natural bijection
\[
    \Hom_{\Top}(|X|, T) \iso \Hom_{\sSet}(X, \Sing(T)),
\]
thus the singular complex functor is \emph{right adjoint} to the geometric
realization,
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \sSet \ar[rr, shift left, "{|-|}"] &&\Top \ar[ll, shift left, "\Sing"]
    \end{tikzcd}
\]

\subsection{Geometric Realization as a CW-complex}

\begin{definition}[Degenerate \(n\)-cell]
    \label{def:degenerate-n-cell}
    Given a simplicial set \(X\), we say that an \(n\)-cell \(x \in X_n\) is
    \emph{degenerate} if \(x \in s_j X_{n-1}\) for some \emph{codegeneracy} map
    \(s_j: X_{n-1} \to X_n\), where \(0 \leq j \leq n-1\).

    Equivalently, \(x\) is denenerate if there exists a \emph{surjective} map
    \(\alpha: [n] \epi [m]\) and \(m\)-cell \(y \in X_m\) for which
    \(x = \alpha^{*} y\).
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Eilenberg-Zilber]
    \label{lem:Eilenberg-Zilber}
    Let \(x\) be a \(n\)-cell of a given simplicial set \(X\). There \emph{exists
        a unique} pair \((\alpha, y)\) such that \(\alpha: [n] \epi [k]\) is a
    \emph{surjective} map and \(y\) is a \emph{non-degenerate} \(k\)-cell of
    \(X\) satisfying \(\alpha^{*} y = x\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    The existence of the pair \((\alpha, y)\) comes straight from definition. Now
    suppose \((\beta, z)\) is another pair satisfying the said property, where \(z\)
    is a non-degenerate \(\ell\)-cell of \(X\). Since pushouts of a pair of
    surjections in \(\Splx\) are absolute (see
    \cref{lem:splx-cat-pushout-surjections}), the pushout of the pair
    \((\alpha, \beta)\):

            \ar[dr, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near end]
            &{[k]} \ar[d, "\gamma"] \\
            {[\ell]} \ar[r, "\omega"'] &{[s]}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    is turned into a pullback by the simplicial set \(X: \Splx^{\op} \to \Set\),
    that is:
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X_n \ar[rd, phantom, very near start, "\lrcorner"]
            &X_k \ar[l, "\alpha^{*}"']
            \\
            X_{\ell} \ar[u, "\beta^{*}"]
            &X_s \ar[u, "\gamma^{*}"'] \ar[l, "\omega^{*}"]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    From the pushout property, \(\gamma\) and \(\omega\) are epimorphisms, thus
    split, \(X\) ensures that \(\gamma^{*}\) and \(\omega^{*}\) are
    split-epimorphisms in \(\Set\). Therefore there exists \(s\)-cells
    \(a, b \in X_s\) such that \(\gamma^{*} a = y\) and \(\omega^{*} b = z\). Notice
    however that we assumed \(y\) and \(z\) to be both non-degenerate, hence it must
    be the case that \(\gamma\) and \(\omega\) are \emph{identities}. This implies
    in \(\beta = \alpha\) and \(y = z\).
\end{proof}

Notice that, given a simplicial set \(X\), we can naturally construct a
\emph{filtration} for \(X\) (see \cref{def:filtered-space}) by defining for each
\(n \in \N\) the subspace \(|X|_n\) of \(|X|\) given by
\[
    |X|_n \coloneq \{
    x \otimes t \in |X| \colon
    (x, t) \in X_k \times \splxtop^k
    \text{ for some } k \leq n
    \},
\]
so that the collection \((|X|_n)_{n \in \N}\) defines a filtration---that is,
\(|X|_n \leq |X|_{n+1}\) and \(|X| = \bigcup_{n \in \N} |X|_n\) is endowed with
the \emph{weak topology} (see \cref{def:weak-topology}).

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:X0-simplicial-set-is-discrete}
    Given a simplicial set \(X\), the subspace \(|X|_0 \subseteq |X|\) is
    \emph{discrete} and given by
    \[
        |X|_0 = X_0 \times \splxtop^0.
    \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We shall create an isomorphism between both spaces. Define a surjective map
    \(X_0 \times \splxtop^0 \epi |X|_0\) by mapping \((x, 1) \mapsto x \otimes
    1\). Now, suppose that for some \(x, y \in X_0\) one has
    \(x \otimes 1 = y \otimes 1\), then there must exist a pair
    \((z, t) \in X_n \times \splxtop^n\), for some \(n \in \N\), and parallel
    morphisms \(\alpha, \beta: [0] \para [n]\) in \(\Splx\) for which
    \[
        (x, \alpha_{*} 1) = (\alpha^{*} z, t)
        \quad \text{ and } \quad
        (y, \beta_{*} 1) = (\beta^{*} z, t).
    \]
    Since \(\splxtop^0 = 1\) is a single point, then \(\alpha_{*} = \beta_{*}\) and
    hence \(\alpha = \beta\), which shows that \(x = y\).
\end{proof}

\begin{notation}
    \label{not:non-degenerate-cells}
    Denote by \(X_n^{\Nondeg}\) the collection of all \emph{non-degenerate
        \(n\)-cells} of a given simplicial set \(X\).
\end{notation}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:unique-non-degenerate-point-geometric-realization}
    Let \(\xi \in |X|\) be any point, and let \(n \in \N\) be the \emph{minimal}
    index such that there exists \((x, t) \in X_n \times \splxtop^n\) for which
    \(\xi = x \otimes t\). Then \(x\) is a non-degenerate simplex, and if
    \(n \geq 1\) then \(t \in \Int \splxtop^n\)---also, if that is the case, then the
    pair \((x, t)\) is unique with such property.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We shall prove this lemma in three steps:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item (\(x\) is non-degenerate) Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(x\)
              is degenerate, so that there exists a pair \((\alpha: [n] \epi [m], y)\) with
              \(y \in X_m\) and \(m < n\) such that \(\alpha^{*} y = x\). From this one
              obtains
              \[
                  x \otimes t = \alpha^{*} y \otimes t = y \otimes \alpha_{*} t
              \]
              then \((y, \alpha_{*} t) \in X_m \times \splxtop^m\) satisfies
              \(\xi = y \otimes \alpha^{*} t\), which contradicts the assumption that \(n\)
              was the minimal element of \(\N\) with this property.

        \item (\(t \in \Int \splxtop^n\)) Assume that \(n \geq 1\) and, for the sake of
              contradiction, suppose that \(t \in \Bd \splxtop^n\)---so that there exists
              at least one coordinate of \(t\) that is zero. From this last comment, it
              follows that there exists an injective map \(\beta: [k] \mono [n]\), for some
              \(k < n\), such that \(t \in \beta_{*} \splxtop^k\). If \(s \in \splxtop^k\) is
              the point such that \(\beta_{*} s = t\), then
              \[
                  \xi = x \otimes t = x \otimes \beta_{*} s = \beta^{*} x \otimes s,
              \]
              but \(\beta^{*} x \in \splxtop^k\), which contradicts again the minimality of
              \(n\).

        \item (Uniqueness of the pair \((x, t)\)) Assume again that \(n \geq 1\), and
              suppose that \(\xi = x \otimes t = y \otimes s\) for some
              \(x, y \in X_n^{\Nondeg}\) and \(t, s \in \Int \splxtop^n\)---which can be
              assumed using the result of the last item. From the definition of \(\otimes\)
              we may consider a finite zig-zag \((\alpha_j, \beta_j)_{j=1}^N\) in \(\Splx\):
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[n_{j-1}]}
                      &&{[m_j]}
                      \\
                      &{[k_j] \ar[lu, "\alpha_j"]} \ar[ru, "\beta_j"']
                      &
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              where \(n_0\) and \(m_N\) are both defined to be \(n\) and the intersection
              \(\im \beta_j \cap \im \alpha_{j+1}\) is \emph{non-empty} for every
              \(1 \leq j < N\)---together with a collection of pairs
              \[
                  \big((x_j, t_j), (y_j, s_j)\big)_{j=0}^N
                  \in \prod_{j=0}^N (X_{k_j} \times \splxtop^{k_j})
                  \times (X_{m_j} \times \splxtop^{m_j})
              \]
              for which one has the following relations:
              \[
                  (x_j, (\alpha_j)_{*} t_j) = (\alpha_j^{*} y_{j-1}, s_{j-1})
                  \quad \text{ and } \quad
                  (x_j, (\beta_j)_{*} t_j) = (\beta_j^{*} y_j, s_j),
              \]
              and \((x_0, t_0) \coloneq (x, t)\), while \((y_N, s_N) \coloneq (y, s)\).

              By hypothesis, since \(t\) and \(s\) are interior points of \(\splxtop^n\), then
              it must be the case that both \(\alpha_1\) and \(\beta_N\) are
              \emph{surjective}, so that \(k_1, k_N \geq n\). We proceed by induction on the
              zig-zag length \(N\). If \(N = 1\), then the zig-zag is composed by two
              \emph{surjective} maps \(\alpha, \beta: [k] \para [n]\). Since pushouts of
              surjective maps exist in \(\Splx\) and are \emph{absolute}, if we consider the
              pushout of the pair \((\alpha, \beta)\):
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[k]} \ar[r, "\alpha"]
                      \ar[d, "\beta"']
                      \ar[rd, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near end]
                      &{[n]} \ar[d, "\gamma"] \\
                      {[n]} \ar[r] &{[\ell]}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              the contravariant functor \(X\) maps this universal square to a
              \emph{pullback} in \(\Set\):
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      X_k \ar[rd, "\lrcorner", very near start, phantom]
                      &X_n \ar[l, "\alpha^{*}"'] \\
                      X_n \ar[u, "\beta^{*}"]
                      &X_{\ell} \ar[u, "\gamma^{*}"'] \ar[l]
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              Then since \(\gamma\) is a split epimorphism, so is \(\gamma^{*}\), which
              proves the existence of an \(\ell\)-cell \(z \in X_{\ell}\) such that
              \(\gamma^{*} z = x\). However, since \(x\) is non-degenerate and \(n\) is
              minimal, this can only happen if \(\ell = n\) so that \(\alpha, \beta =
              \Id_{[n]}\)---implying on \((x, t) = (y, s)\).

              Assume, for the hypothesis of induction, that equality of the points is
              stablished for some \(N-1 > 1\). We now work on the case \(N > 1\): our goal
              will be to shorten the zig-zag sequence by one. Start by factoring the
              morphism \(\beta_1\) as follows
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[k_1]} \ar[rr, "\beta_1"] \ar[rd, two heads, "\varepsilon"']
                      & &{[m_1]} \\
                      &{[m_1']} \ar[ur, tail, "\delta"'] &
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              If we now consider the pushout of the pair of \emph{surjective} maps
              \((\alpha_1, \varepsilon)\), the simplicial set takes this pushout to a
              \emph{pullback} in \(\Set\) and from an analogous argument as done above, we
              conclude that we must have \(\varepsilon = \Id_{[k_1]}\). Therefore the
              factorization of \(\beta_1\) reduces solely to \(\beta_1 = \delta\), which is
              a \emph{monomorphism}. Since \(\im \alpha_2 \cap \im \beta_1 \neq \emptyset\),
              then by \cref{lem:splx-cat-pullback-mono-pushout-epi} we know that the
              pullback of the pair \((\beta_1, \alpha_2)\) exists in \(\Splx\):
              \begin{equation}\label{eq:pullback-unique-nd-pt-xi}
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[k_1']} \ar[r, tail, "\theta"]
                      \ar[rd, phantom, very near start, "\lrcorner"]
                      \ar[d, "\eta"']
                      &{[k_2]} \ar[d, "\alpha_2"] \\
                      {[k_1]} \ar[r, tail, "\beta_1"'] &{[m_1]}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \end{equation}
              Considering the simplex covariant functor \(\splxtop^{\bullet}\), we have a
              corresponding square
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      \splxtop^{k_1'} \ar[r, tail, "\theta_{*}"]
                      \ar[d, "\eta_{*}"']
                      \ar[rd, phantom, very near start, "\lrcorner"]
                      &\splxtop^{k_2} \ar[d, "(\alpha_2)_{*}"] \\
                      \splxtop^{k_1} \ar[r, tail, "(\beta_1)_{*}"'] &\splxtop^{m_1}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              in \(\Top\), which is again a pullback.
              \todo[inline]{Prove that \(\splxtop^{\bullet}\) does indeed preserve the pullback}
              % To prove the latter statement, consider any two continuous maps \(\theta': T
              % \to \Delta^{k_2}\) and \(\eta': T \to \Delta^{k_1}\) such that \((\alpha_2)_{*}
              % \theta' = (\beta_1)_{*} \eta'\). Since \(\beta_1\) is a split monomorphism, so
              % is \(\theta\) and since functors preserve split monic arrows, there exists
              % retractions \(r: \Delta^{k_2} \to \Delta^{k_1'}\) of \(\theta_{*}\) and \(p:
              % \Delta^{m_1} \to \Delta^{k_1}\) of \((\beta_1)_{*}\).
              Therefore can find \(c \in X_{k_1'}\) such that
              \(c = \eta^{*} x_1 = \theta^{*} y_1\), and take the \emph{unique}
              \(w \in \splxtop^{k_1'}\) such that \(\eta_{*} w = t_1\) and
              \(\theta_{*} w = s_1\).

              Notice that by the pullback \cref{eq:pullback-unique-nd-pt-xi} one has
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {[n]} & &{[m_1]} & &{[m_2]}
                      \\
                      &{[k_1]} \ar[ul, "\alpha_1"]
                      \ar[ru, tail, "\beta_1"]
                      &
                      &{[k_2]} \ar[ru, "\beta_2"']
                      \ar[lu, "\alpha_2"']

                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              so together with the pair \((c, w) \in X_{k_1'} \times \splxtop^{k_1'}\) and
              \([n] \overset{\alpha_1 \eta} \longleftarrow [k_1'] \overset{\beta_2
                  \theta}\longrightarrow [m_2]\) we can shorten the zig-zag length by one,
              yielding the case \(N - 1\), which is true by hypothesis. Therefore
              \((x, t) = (y, s)\) and the lemma follows.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:geometric-realization-is-CW-complex}
    Let \(X\) be a simplicial set. The geometric realization of \(X\) has a natural
    structure of a CW-complex with exactly one closed \(n\)-cell
    \(\widehat x: \splxtop^n \to |X|\) for each non-degenerate \(n\)-cell
    \(x \in X_n\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let \((x, t), (y, s) \in \coprod_{x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}} \splxtop^n\) be any two
    points.  We analyse the case where \(x \otimes t = y \otimes s\) are equivalent
    points of \(|X|_n\) by means of
    \cref{lem:unique-non-degenerate-point-geometric-realization}:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item If both \(t, s \in \Int \splxtop^n\) then by the uniqueness of
              representatives we find that
              \[
                  (x, t) = (y, s).
              \]

        \item Now if for instance \(t \in \Bd \splxtop^n\), then there exits a
              unique \((z, r) \in X_k \times \Int \splxtop^k\) for some minimal \(k < n\)
              such that \(x \otimes t = z \otimes t\). Notice however that since \(k\) is
              minimal and unique with such property, then it must be the case that
              \(s \in \Bd \splxtop^n\)---therefore in this case one has both points
              \[
                  (x, t), (y, s) \in \coprod_{x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}} \Bd \splxtop^n.
              \]
    \end{itemize}
    From this we can conclude that the following square is a pushout in \(\Top\):
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \coprod_{x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}} \Bd \splxtop^n
            \ar[dd, hook]
            \ar[rr]
            \ar[rdrd, "\ulcorner", phantom, very near end]
            &&{|X|_{n-1}} \ar[dd, hook]
            \\
            &&
            \\
            \coprod_{x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}} \splxtop^n
            \ar[rr, "(\widehat x)_{x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}}"']
            &&{|X|_n}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    which proves that \(|X|\) is a \(CW\)-complex.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Skeletal filtrations in \(\sSet\)]
    \label{def:skeletal-filtration-sset}
    Let \(X\) be a simplicial set. We define the \emph{skeletal filtration} of \(X\)
    to be the collection \((\Sk_n X)_{n \in \N}\) of simplicial sets, where
    \(\Sk_n X\) is the \emph{smallest subcomplex} of \(X\) containing every
    \(k\)-cell \(x \in X_k\) for each \(0 \leq k \leq n\). Explicitly, the
    collection of \(k\)-cells of \(\Sk_n X\) is
    \[
        (\Sk_n X)_k = \bigcup_{0 \leq j \leq k}
        \big\{ x f \in X_k
        \colon x \in X_j
        \text{ and }
        f \in \Hom_{\Splx}([k], [j])\big\}.
    \]
    Therefore for each \(n \in \N\) the simplicial set \(\Sk_n X\) is a
    \emph{subcomplex} of \(\Sk_{n+1} X\).

    From construction we see that
    \[
        X = \Colim_{n \in \N} \Sk_n X,
    \]
    which is, loosely, the \emph{union} of all \(\Sk_n X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[On \cref{def:skeletal-filtration-sset}]
    \label{rem:on-the-skeletal-filtration-of-a-sset}
    Note by a subobject \(S \in \sSet\) of the simplicial set \(X\) we actually
    mean an isomorphism class of \emph{natural monomorphisms}---meaning, a class of
    natural transformations \(\eta: S \nat X\) for which each associated morphism
    \(\eta_{[n]}: S_n \mono X_n\) is a monomorphism in \(\Set\). We say that
    \((S, \eta)\) is \emph{equivalent} to another subobject \((B, \xi: B \nat X)\)
    of \(X\) if there exists a \emph{natural isomorphism} \(\sigma: S \isonat B\)
    such that, for any \([n] \in \Splx\), the diagram
    \[

              follows: for each \(n \in \N\), the set \(P_n\) is the pullback

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:filtration-attaching-cells}
    Given a simplicial set \(X\), the square
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \coprod_{x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}} \Bd \Delta^n
            \ar[rd, phantom, very near end, "\ulcorner"]

            &\Sk_n X
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    is a pushout in \(\sSet\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(P \in \sSet\) be the pushout of the given square, and define
    \(p: P \to \Sk_n X\) to be unique morphism of simplicial sets making the diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \coprod_{x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}} \Bd \Delta^n

    \]
    commute in \(\sSet\). We'll show that \(p\) is an isomorphism of simplicial
    sets:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item (Epimorphism) Let \(x \in (\Sk X_n)_k\) be any \(k\)-cell, and let
              \((y, \alpha: [k] \epi [m])\) be the unique representative pair of \(x\) with
              \(y \in X_m\) being a non-degenerate \(m\)-cell such that
              \(x = y \alpha\) and \(m \leq k\). If it is the case that \(m < n\), then
              \(x\) is a degenerate \(k\)-cell and also \(y \in \Sk_{n-1} X\)---but then
              \(x \in \Sk_{n-1} X\) via \(\alpha^{*}\), showing that \(x \in \im p_k\). For
              the case where \(m = n\) we see that \(x\) is non-degenerate and therefore
              \((x, \splx^n) \in \coprod_{x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}} \splx^n\), thus
              \(x \in \im p_k\) by the commutativity of
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {(x, \splx^n)}
                      \ar[r]
                      \ar[rd, "x"']
                      &P_k \ar[d, "p_k"] \\
                      &{(\Sk_n X)_{k}}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              where \(x: \splx^n \to (\Sk_n X)_k\) is the unique representative morphism of
              \(x\).

        \item (Monomorphism) To prove that \(p\) is a monomorphism it suffices to show
              the following two properties:
              \begin{enumerate}[(i)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
                  \item Let \(x \in X_n^{\Nondeg}\) be any non-degenerate \(n\)-cell and consider
                        the canonical morphisms \(x: \splx^n \to \Sk_n X\) and
                        \(\Sk_{n-1} X \mono \Sk_n X\)---we'll show that the \emph{pullback} of this
                        pair of morphisms is \(\Bd \splx^n\).

                        Let \(\alpha \in \splx^n[k]\) be a \(k\)-cell such that the \(k\)-cell
                        \(x \alpha \in X_k\) is an element of \((\Sk_{n-1} X)_k\). Suppose, for the
                        sake of contradiction, that \(\alpha\) is an epimorphism, so that
                        \(n \leq k\). Since \(x \alpha\) a \(k\)-cell of the \((n-1)\)-skeleton, the
                        unique pair \((y, \beta: [k] \epi [m])\)---where \(y \in X_m\) is
                        non-degenerate with \(m < n\) and \(y \beta = x \alpha\)---is such that
                        \(y \in (\Sk_n X)_m\). Since \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are epimorphisms in
                        \(\Splx\), their pushout exists and is absolute:
                        \[
                            \begin{tikzcd}
                                {[k]} \ar[r, "\alpha", two heads]
                                \ar[d, two heads, "\beta"']
                                \ar[dr, phantom, very near end, "\ulcorner"]
                                &{[n]} \ar[d, "\delta"] \\
                                {[m]} \ar[r, "\gamma"']
                                &{[\ell]}
                            \end{tikzcd}
                        \]
                        Since \(X\) is covariant, the corresponding square is a pullback in \(\sSet\):
                        \[
                            \begin{tikzcd}
                                X_k
                                \ar[dr, phantom, very near start, "\lrcorner"]
                                &X_n \ar[l, "\alpha^{*}"', two heads] \\
                                X_m
                                \ar[u, two heads, "\beta^{*}"]
                                &X_{\ell} \ar[l, "\gamma^{*}"]
                                \ar[u, "\delta^{*}"']
                            \end{tikzcd}
                        \]
                        Using the fact that \(y \beta = x \alpha\), there exists \(z \in X_{\ell}\)
                        such that \(z \delta = x\) and \(z \gamma = y\). Since \(x\) is assumed to be
                        non-degenerate, and \(\delta\) is an epimorphism with \(\ell \leq n\) and
                        \(z \delta = x\), then it must be the case that \(\delta = \Id_{[n]}\) and
                        hence \(\ell = n\). Note however that \(m < n\) so that
                        \(\gamma: [m] \to [n]\) should not be able to be an epimorphism, which is a
                        contradiction.  From this it follows that \(\alpha\) isn't an epimorphism and
                        hence \(\alpha \in \Bd \splx^n[k]\) is a \(k\)-cell of the boundary. We thus
                        conclude that
                        \[
                            \begin{tikzcd}

                  \item Given any two \emph{distinct} non-degenerate \(n\)-cells \(x, y \in

                        be a pullback in \(\sSet\). Our goal will be to show that \(v\) and \(w\) can
                        be factored through the monomorphism \(\Bd \splx^n \mono \splx^n\).

                        Consider a pair of \(k\)-cells \(\alpha, \beta \in \splx^n[k]\) such that
                        \(x \alpha = y \beta\). First, notice that if one of them was an identity map,
                        then \(k\) would coincide with \(n\) and it would follow that both \(\alpha\)
                        and \(\beta\) are identities, yielding \(x = y\), which contradicts the
                        assumption of \(x\) and \(y\) being distinct cells. We can therefore assume
                        that neither \(\alpha\) nor \(\beta\) are identities. Consider the
                        factorization
                        \[

                        Since \(\alpha_{-}\) and \(\beta_{-}\) are epimorphisms, their pushout exists
                        and is absolute:

                            \end{tikzcd}
                        \end{equation}
                        Since \(X\) is covariant, the corresponding square is a pullback in \(\sSet\):
                        \[
                            \begin{tikzcd}

                        \]
                        Therefore there exists \(z \in X_{\ell}\) for which
                        \(z \alpha_{-} \gamma = x\) while \(z \delta \beta_{-} = y\). Now, since both
                        \(x\) and \(y\) are non-degenerate cells, it follows that all maps in
                        \cref{eq:pushout-proving-p-is-monic} are identity morphisms. It then follows
                        that \(\alpha = \alpha_{+}\) and \(\beta = \beta_{+}\) are
                        monomorphisms. Since neither of them is an identity, it follows that
                        \(\alpha, \beta \in \Bd \splx^n\) are \(k\)-cells of the boundary. This shows
                        that \(v\) and \(w\) can be both factorized through
                        \(\Bd \splx^n \mono \splx^n\).

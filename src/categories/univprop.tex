\section{Products}

\begin{definition}[Product]
\label{def:product}
Let \(J\) be a set, and \((C_j)_{j \in I}\) be a
collection of objects in a category \(\cat C\).

A \emph{product} of such collection, \emph{if it exists}, is a pair
\((P, (\pi_j)_{j \in J})\) --- where \(P\) is an object of \(\cat C\), and for
every \(j \in J\), \(\pi_j: P \to C_j\) is a morphism of \(\cat C\).

Furthermore, this pair has to satisfy the following \emph{universal property}:
for every pair \((Q, (q_j)_{j \in J})\) --- where \(Q \in \cat C\) and for every
\(j \in J\), \(q_j: Q \to C_j\) is a morphism in \(\cat C\) --- there exists a
\emph{unique morphism} \(f: Q \unique P\) of \(\cat C\) such that, for every
\(j \in J\) the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
Q \ar[rd, "q_j", bend left] \ar[d, dashed, "f"'] & \\
P \ar[r, "\pi_j"'] & C_j
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Uniqueness]
\label{prop:product-unique-up-to-iso}
The product of a collection of objects, if existent, is \emph{unique up to
  isomorphism}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\cat C\) be a category admitting the product of a collection
\((C_j)_{j \in J}\) of objects of \(\cat C\), and \(J\) is a set. Let
\((P, (p_j)_{j \in J})\) and \((Q, (q_j)_{j \in J})\) be products of
\((C_j)_{j \in J}\) in the category \(\cat C\). Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are
products, there exists unique morphisms \(f: Q \to P\) and \(g: P \to Q\) such
that, for all \(j \in J\), we have \(q_j = p_j f\) and \(p_j = q_j g\).

Moreover, one can apply the product property of \(P\) to \(P\) itself: there
exists a unique morphism \(h: P \to P\) such that, for all \(j \in J\), we have
\(p_j = p_j h\). For that to be true, it is clear that we must have
\(h = \Id_{P}\). Note, however, that for each \(j \in J\),
\[
p_j = q_j g = p_j f g.
\]
Since \(h\) is unique, we obtain \(f g = h = \Id_P\).  On the other hand,
applying the product property of \(Q\) in \(Q\) will yield \(g f = \Id_Q\). This
shows that \(Q \iso P\) in \(\cat C\), via \(f\) and \(g\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Products are independent of ordering]
\label{prop:product-ordering-independent}
Let \(I\) be a set and \((J_k)_{k \in K}\) be a partition of \(I\) by disjoint
subsets \(J_k \subseteq I\). Let \((C_i)_{i \in I}\) be a collection of objects
in a category \(\cat C\). Then, if all the products presented below exist in
\(\cat C\), they are isomorphic:
\[
\prod_{i \in I} C_i \iso \prod_{k \in K} \bigg(\prod_{j \in J_k} C_j \bigg).
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Define the following collections:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Let \((q_k)_{k \in K}\) be the collection of morphisms
  \(q_{k_0}: \prod_{k \in K} \bigg( \prod_{j \in J_k} C_j \bigg) \to C_{k_0}\),
  for each \(k_0 \in K\), associated with the product
  \(\prod_{k \in K} \bigg( \prod_{j \in J_k} C_j \bigg)\) in \(\cat C\).

\item For all \(k \in K\), let \((p_j)_{j \in J_k}\) be the collection of
  morphisms \(p_{j_0}: \prod_{j \in J_k} C_j \to C_{j_0}\), for each
  \(j_0 \in J_k\) associated with the product \(\prod_{j \in J_k} C_j\) in
  \(\cat C\).
\end{itemize}
Let \((L, (\ell)_{i \in I})\) be a pair where \(L \in \cat C\) and
\(\ell_i: L \to C_i\) is a morphism in \(\cat C\) for each \(i \in I\).

Define a collection \((g_k)_{k \in K}\) where, for each \(k_0 \in K\), we let
\(g_{k_0}: L \to \prod_{j \in J_{k_0}} C_j\) be the unique morphism of
\(\cat C\) such that \(\ell_i = g_{k_0} p_i\) for every \(i \in J_k\). Let
\(f: \prod_{k \in K} \bigg( \prod_{j \in J_k} C_j \bigg)\) be the unique
morphism of \(\cat C\) such that \(g_k = q_k f\).

We see that the following diagram commutes for every \(k_0 \in K\) and
\(i \in J_k\):
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
L \ar[rrrrdd, bend left, "\ell_i"]
\ar[dd, dashed, "f"']
\ar[rrdd, dashed, "g_{k_0}" description]
& & & &\\ & & & & \\
\prod_{k \in K} \bigg( \prod_{j \in J_k} C_j \bigg)
\ar[rr, "q_{k_0}"']
&
&\prod_{j \in J_{k_0}} C_j \ar[rr, "p_i"']
&
&C_i
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Since \(I = \bigcup_{k \in K} J_k\), the diagram commutes for any \(i \in I\)
--- thus \(\prod_{k \in K} \bigg( \prod_{j \in J_k} C_j \bigg)\) is a product of
the collection \((C_i)_{i \in I}\). Now, \cref{prop:product-unique-up-to-iso}
finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{Coproducts}

\begin{definition}[Coproduct]
\label{def:coproduct}
Let \(J\) be a set, and \((C_j)_{j \in I}\) be a
collection of objects in a category \(\cat C\).

A \emph{coproduct} of such collection, \emph{if it exists}, is a pair
\((P, (\iota_j)_{j \in J})\) --- where \(P\) is an object of \(\cat C\), and for
every \(j \in J\), \(\iota_j: P \to C_j\) is a morphism of \(\cat C\).

Furthermore, this pair has to satisfy the following \emph{universal property}:
for every pair \((Q, (q_j)_{j \in J})\) --- where \(Q \in \cat C\) and for every
\(j \in J\), \(q_j: C_j \to Q\) is a morphism in \(\cat C\) --- there exists a
\emph{unique morphism} \(f: P \unique Q\) of \(\cat C\) such that, for every
\(j \in J\) the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
P \ar[d, dashed, "f"']
&C_j \ar[l, "\iota_j"'] \ar[ld, bend left, "q_j"] \\
Q &
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{definition}

We can see right away that coproducts are dual to products, yielding the
following two dual properties.

\begin{proposition}[Uniqueness]
\label{prop:coproduct-unique-up-to-iso}
If a coproduct of a collection of objects of a category exists, then this
coproduct is \emph{unique up to isomorphism}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[Coproducts are independent of ordering]
\label{prop:coproduct-ordering-independent}
Let \(I\) be a set and \((J_k)_{k \in K}\) be a partition of \(I\) by disjoint
subsets \(J_k \subseteq I\). Let \((C_i)_{i \in I}\) be a collection of objects
in a category \(\cat C\). Then, if all the coproducts presented below exist in
\(\cat C\), they are isomorphic:
\[
\coprod_{i \in I} C_i \iso \coprod_{k \in K} \bigg(\coprod_{j \in J_k} C_j \bigg).
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}[Duality]
\label{rem:coproducts-dual-product}
Coproducts are \emph{dual} to products in the following sense: if \(P\) is a
product in a category \(\cat C\), then \(P^{\op}\) is a coproduct in the
opposite category \(\cat C^{\op}\). Notice however that one \emph{cannot} simply
reverses the arrows of a product in \(\cat C\) and end up with a coproduct in
\(\cat C\) --- in fact, there are categories where product do exist, while
coproducts do not.
\end{remark}

\section{Equalizers and Coequalizers}

\begin{definition}[Equalizer]
\label{def:equalizer}
Let \(f, g: A \para B\) be parallel morphisms in a category \(\cat C\). An
\emph{equalizer of \(f\) and \(g\)} is a pair \((K, k)\) --- where
\(K \in \cat C\) is an object and \(k: K \to A\) is a morphism of \(\cat C\) for
which \(f k = g k\) --- such that, for any object \(M \in \cat C\) and morphism
\(m: M \to A\) of \(\cat C\) satisfying \(f m = g m\), there exists a
\emph{unique} morphism \(n: M \to K\) such that the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
M \ar[d, dashed, "n"'] \ar[rd, bend left, "m"] & &
\\
K \ar[r, "k"'] &A \ar[r, shift left, "f"] \ar[r, shift right, "g"'] &B
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{definition}

Just as with products and coproducts, one has a dual notion of an equalizer, we
call it a \emph{coequalizer}. For the sake of later reference, we write down its
definition.

\begin{definition}[Coequalizer]
\label{def:coequalizer}
Let \(f, g: A \para B\) be parallel morphisms in a category \(\cat C\). An
\emph{equalizer of \(f\) and \(g\)} is a pair \((C, c)\) --- where
\(C \in \cat C\) is an object and \(c: B \to C\) is a morphism of \(\cat C\) for
which \(c f = c g\) --- such that, for any object \(M \in \cat C\) and morphism
\(m: B \to M\) of \(\cat C\) satisfying \(m f = m g\), there exists a
\emph{unique} morphism \(n: C \to M\) such that the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
C \ar[d, dashed, "n"]
& B \ar[l, "c"'] \ar[ld, "m", bend left]
& A \ar[l, shift left, "g"] \ar[l, shift right, "f"']
\\
M& &
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Uniqueness]
\label{prop:(co)equalizer-unique-up-to-iso}
Given two parallel morphisms \(f, g: A \para B\) in a category \(\cat C\), if
the (co)equalizer of them exists, then it is \emph{unique up to isomorphism}. We
denote \emph{the} equalizer of \(f\) and \(g\) by \(\Eq(f, g)\) and the
coequalizer of \(f\) and \(g\) by \(\Coeq(f, g)\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We prove for equalizers. Let \((K, k)\) and \((K', k')\) be equalizers of \(f\)
and \(g\). If we apply the equalizer property of \((K', k')\) in \((K, k)\) and
vice versa, we obtain unique morphisms \(n': K \to K'\) and \(n: K' \to K\) such
that \(k = k' n'\) and \(k' = k n\).

Moreover, applying the equalizer property of \((K, k)\) in itself we obtain a
unique \(t: K \to K\) such that \(k = k t\) --- therefore \(t = \Id_K\). Since
\(k = k' n = k \Id_K\) and \(\Id_K\) is unique with such property, it follows
that, since \(k = k' n' = (k n) n' = k (n n')\) we find that \(n n' =
\Id_K\). On the other hand, doing the same for \((K', k')\) implies in \(n' n =
\Id_{K'}\). Therefore \(K \iso K'\) in \(\cat C\), via \(n\) and \(n'\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:self-(co)equalizer}
Given a morphism \(f: A \to B\) in a category \(\cat C\), the (co)equalizer of
\(f\) with itself always exists --- in fact \(\Eq(f, f) = (A, \Id_A)\) and
\(\Coeq(f, f) = (B, \Id_{B})\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:eq-monic-coeq-epic}
Let \(\cat C\) be a category and \(f, g: A \para B\) be parallel morphisms in
\(\cat C\). The following are properties concerning equalizers and coequalizers:
\begin{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item If \(f\) and \(g\) have an equalizer \(\Eq(f, g)\) in \(\cat C\), the
  morphism \(\Eq(f, g) \mono A\) associated to the equalizer is a
  \emph{monomorphism}.

\item If \(f\) and \(g\) have an coequalizer \(\Coeq(f, g)\) in \(\cat C\), the
  morphism \(B \epi \Coeq(f, g)\) associated to the coequalizer is an
  \emph{epimorphism}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The properties are dual to each other, thus we may simply prove the one
concerning equalizers. Let \(k: \Eq(f, g) \to A\) be the morphism in \(\cat C\)
associated to the equalizer. Consider any two parallel morphisms \(x, y: C \para
\Eq(f, g)\) such that \(k x = k y\) --- therefore, the following diagram
commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
C \ar[r, shift left, "x"] \ar[r, shift right, "y"']
& \Eq(f, g) \ar[r, "k"]
& A \ar[r, shift left, "f"] \ar[r, shift right, "g"']
& B
\end{tikzcd}
\]
From the diagram we obtain the relation \(f (k x) = g (k x)\). Since \(k x: C
\to A\), the universal property implies that \(x\) must be the unique --- hence
\(y = x\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:epi-and-eq-is-iso}
Let \(f: A \to B\) be a morphism of a category \(\cat C\). If \(f\) is both an
\emph{epimorphism and equalizer}\footnote{This is clearly an abuse of language,
  the equalizer is in fact \(A\) and \(f\) is the morphism associated with
  \(A\).}, then \(f\) is an \emph{isomorphism}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(x, y: B \para C\) be parallel morphisms in \(\cat C\) with \(\Eq(x, y) =
f\), then
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A \ar[r, "f"] & B \ar[r, shift right, "g"'] \ar[r, shift left, "f"] &C
\end{tikzcd}
\]
which implies in \(x f = y f\). By hypothesis \(f\) is an epimorphism, thus
\(x = y\). Notice however that the equalizer of a morphism \(B \to C\) with
itself is the identity on \(B\). Since equalizers are unique up to isomorphism,
it follows that \(f \iso \Id_B\) --- thus \(f\) itself is an isomorphism (and
\(A \iso B\)).
\end{proof}

\section{Pullbacks \& Pushouts}

\begin{definition}[Pullback]
\label{def:pullback}
Let \(f: A \to C\) and \(g: B \to C\) be any two morphisms in a category
\(\cat C\). A \emph{pullback of \((f, g)\)} is a triple \((P, f', g')\)
where the diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
P \ar[r, "f'"] \ar[d, "g'"'] &B \ar[d, "g"]
\\
A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
\end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes in \(\cat C\), and for every other triple \((Q, f'', g'')\) making the
diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
Q \ar[r, "f''"] \ar[d, "g''"'] &B \ar[d, "g"]
\\
A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
\end{tikzcd}
\]
commute in \(\cat C\), there exists a unique morphism \(\ell: Q \to P\) in
\(\cat C\) such that the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
Q \ar[dr, dashed, "\ell"]
\ar[rrd, bend left, "f''"]
\ar[drd, bend right, "g''"']
& &
\\
&P \ar[r, "f'"] \ar[d, "g'"'] &B \ar[d, "g"]
\\
&A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{definition}

We usually denote that a square is a pullback in \(\cat C\) by marking it as
follows
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
P \ar[r, "f'"] \ar[d, "g'"'] \ar[dr, phantom, "\lrcorner", very near start]
&B \ar[d, "g"]
\\
A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
\end{tikzcd}
\]

The \emph{dual} notion of a pullback is that of a pushout, just as before,
we'll write it down just for the sake of later reference.

\begin{definition}[Pushout]
\label{def:pushout}
Let \(f: C \to A\) and \(g: C \to B\) be any two morphisms in a category
\(\cat C\). A \emph{pushout of \((f, g)\)} is a triple \((P, f', g')\)
where the diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
C \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, "g"'] &A \ar[d, "g'"] \\
B \ar[r, "f'"'] &P
\end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes in \(\cat C\), and for every other triple \((Q, f'', g'')\) making the
diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
C \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, "g"'] &A \ar[d, "g''"] \\
B \ar[r, "f''"'] &Q
\end{tikzcd}
\]
commute in \(\cat C\), there exists a unique morphism \(\ell: P \to Q\) in
\(\cat C\) such that the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
C \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, "g"']
&A \ar[d, "g'"] \ar[drd, bend left, "g''"]
&
\\
B \ar[r, "f'"'] \ar[rrd, bend right, "f''"']
&P \ar[dr, dashed, "\ell"]
&
\\
& &Q
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{definition}

Analogously, if we want to visually say that a square is a pushout in \(\cat
C\), we mark it as follows
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
C \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, "g"'] &A \ar[d, "g'"] \\
B \ar[r, "f'"'] &P \ar[lu, phantom, "\lrcorner", very near start]
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{proposition}[Uniqueness]
\label{prop:pullback-pushout-uniqueness}
The pullback (or pushout) of two morphisms, if existent, is \emph{unique up to
  isomorphism}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(f: A \to C\) and \(g: B \to C\) be two morphisms in a category \(\cat
C\). Suppose there exists two pullbacks of \((f, g)\), namely \((P, f', g'')\)
and \((Q, f'', g'')\). Let \(\phi: P \to Q\) and \(\psi: Q \to P\) be the
uniquely defined morphisms given by the universal property of the
pullback. Consider the following two commutative diagrams
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
P \ar[rd, dashed, "\phi"]
\ar[rrrdd, bend left=50, "f'"]
\ar[ddrrd, bend right=50, "g'"']
& & &
\\
&Q \ar[dr, dashed, "\psi"]
\ar[rrd, bend left, "f''"]
\ar[drd, bend right, "g''"']
& &
\\
& &P \ar[r, "f'"] \ar[d, "g'"']
&B \ar[d, "g"]
\\
& &A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
\end{tikzcd}
\qquad \qquad
\begin{tikzcd}
Q \ar[rd, dashed, "\psi"]
\ar[rrrdd, bend left=50, "f''"]
\ar[ddrrd, bend right=50, "g''"']
& & &
\\
&P \ar[dr, dashed, "\phi"]
\ar[rrd, bend left, "f'"]
\ar[drd, bend right, "g'"']
& &
\\
& &Q \ar[r, "f''"] \ar[d, "g''"']
&B \ar[d, "g"]
\\
& &A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Notice, however, that since \(\Id_P: P \to P\) and \(\Id_Q: Q \to Q\) also make
them commute --- respectively, the left and right diagrams. From uniqueness we
obtain \(\phi \psi = \Id_P\) and \(\psi \phi = \Id_Q\) --- therefore \(P \iso
Q\) in \(\cat C\), via \(\phi\) and \(\psi\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:preservation-monic-epic-iso-by-pull-push}
Let \((P, f', g')\) be the pullback of a pair of morphisms \((f, g)\) in a
category \(\cat C\), then:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item If \(g\) is a monomorphism, then \(g'\) is also a monomorphism.
\item If \(g\) is an isomorphism, then \(g'\) is also an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
Dually, if \((B, f'', g'')\) is the pushout of the pair \((f, g)\), then:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setcounter{enumi}{2}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item If \(g\) is an epimorphism, then \(g''\) is also an epimorphism.
\item If \(g\) is an isomorphism, then \(g''\) is also an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We only prove items (a) and (b), since (c) and (d) are merely dual consequences
of the former items.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Let \(g\) be a monomorphism and consider parallel morphisms \(u, v: Q
  \para P\) such that \(g' u = g' v\) --- we want to prove that \(u = v\). Take
  into account the following commutative diagram
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
  Q \ar[rd, shift left, "u"] \ar[rd, shift right, "v"'] & & \\
  &P \ar[r, "f'"] \ar[d, "g'"']
  \ar[rd, phantom, very near start, "\lrcorner"]
  &B \ar[d, "g"] \\
  &A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]

  Lets first consider the morphism \(u\). Notice that \(p \coloneq g' u\) and
  \(q \coloneq f' u\) are such that \(f p = g q\). From the universal property
  of the pullback we have that \(u\) is the unique morphism factorizing
  \((p, q)\) through \((g, f)\).

  On the other hand, if we consider the arrow \(v\), one can define
  \(p' \coloneq g' v\) and \(q' \coloneq f' v\) so that \(f p' = g q'\) --- thus
  \(v\) is the unique factorization of \((p', q')\) through \((g, f)\). Notice,
  however, that from construction \(p' = g' v = g' u = p\). Moreover,
  \[
  g q' = f p' = f (g' v) = f (g' u) = f p = g q,
  \]
  since \(g\) is a monomorphism, it follows that \(g q' = g q\) implies
  \(q' = q\). Therefore both \(u\) and \(v\) are factorizations of the same pair
  of morphisms --- and from uniqueness, it can only be the case that \(u = v\).

\item Suppose \(g\) is an isomorphism and consider the following commutative
  diagram
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
  A \ar[rrd, "g^{-1} f", bend left]
  \ar[drd, "\Id_{A}"', bend right]
  \ar[rd, "\ell", dashed]
  & &
  \\
  &P \ar[r, "f'"] \ar[d, "g'"']
  &B \ar[d, "g"]
  \\
  &A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Thus \(g' \ell = \Id_A\) is already given. We can now consider the diagram
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:pullback-pres-iso}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  P \ar[rrd, "f' (\ell g')", bend left]
  \ar[drd, "g' (\ell g')"', bend right]
  \ar[rd, "\ell g'", dashed]
  & &
  \\
  &P \ar[r, "f'"] \ar[d, "g'"']
  &B \ar[d, "g"]
  \\
  &A \ar[r, "f"'] &C
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation}
  Moreover, we consider the following composition
  \[
  g' (\ell g') = (g' \ell) g' = \Id_A g' = g' = g' \Id_P,
  \]
  on the other hand we have
  \[
  f' (\ell g') = (f' \ell) g'
  = (g^{-1} f) g' = g^{-1} (f g')
  = g^{-1} (g f') = f' = f' \Id_P.
  \]
  Therefore \(g' (\ell g') = g' \Id_P\) and \(f' (\ell g') = f' \Id_P\) but by
  uniqueness, since \(\Id_P\) also makes \cref{eq:pullback-pres-iso} commute, it
  follows that \(\ell g' = \Id_P\). Thus \(g'\) is an isomorphism with inverse
  \(\ell\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Kernel \& cokernel]
\label{def:kernel-cokernel}
Let \(f: A \to B\) be a morphism in a category \(\cat C\). The \emph{(co)kernel}
of \(f\), if existent, is defined to be the pullback of \(f\) with itself --- or
pushout in the case of cokernels.
\end{definition}

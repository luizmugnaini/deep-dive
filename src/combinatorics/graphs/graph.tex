\section{General Definition Of a Graph}

\begin{notation}[\(k\)-subsets]
  Given a set \(A\), we define a \(k\)-subset --- where \(0 \leq k \leq |A|\)
  --- to be the a subset of \(A\) with exactly \(k\) elements. We denote the
  collection of all \(k\)-subsets of \(A\) as \([A]^k\).
\end{notation}

\begin{notation}[Range]
  For any \(n \in \N\), we denote by \([n]\) the set of natural numbers \(\{0,
  1, \dots, n\}\).
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[General Graph]\label{def: general-graph}
   We define a \emph{general graph} \(G = (V, E, d)\) as a collection of
   disjoint sets \(V\) and \(E\) --- called, respectively, the vertices and
   edges of \(G\) --- together with a map \(d\) that defines the relations of
   incidence (see \cref{def: incidence} between vertices and edges --- that is,
   it defines the formation of edges between vertices.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Incidence]\label{def: incidence}
  We say that a vertex \(x\) is \emph{incident} with an edge \(e\) if \(x \in
  e\). Moreover if \(x \in e\), we say that \(e\) is an edge \emph{at} \(x\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Adjacency]
  Given vertices \(x, y \in e\), we say that \(x\) and \(y\) are the
  \emph{endvertices} or \emph{ends} of the edge \(e\) --- \(x\) and \(y\) are
  then said to be \emph{adjecent} or \emph{neighbours}.

  We say that two edges \(e\) and \(g\) are \emph{adjacent} or \emph{neighbours}
  if there exists a unique vertex \(x\) common to both of them --- \(x \in e\)
  and \(x \in g\).

  A set of vertices, or edges, is said to be independent if no pair of elements
  is adjacent. An independent set of vertices \(V\) is called stable.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Vertice Diagonal]
  Let \(G = (V, E)\) be a graph. We define the diagonal subset of \(V\) to be
  the collection \(\Delta_V = \{(x, x) : x \in V\}\). So that we have
  \(V^2 \setminus \Delta_V = \{(x, y) : x \neq y\}\) --- the collection of
  unordered pairs of distinct vertices.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  We define the set \(\langle V \rangle^2\) to be the quotient
  \[
    \langle V \rangle^2 = (V^2 \setminus \Delta_V)/_{(x, y) \sim (y, x)}.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}[Vertices and edges of a graph]
  Given a graph \(G\), its collection of vertices and edges are denoted by,
  respectively, \(V(G)\) and \(E(G)\).
\end{notation}

\begin{notation}[Collection of edges]
  Given sets \(X\) and \(Y\), we denote the collection of all edges of the form
  \(xy\), where \(x \in X\) and \(y \in Y\), by \(E(X, Y)\). The collection of
  all edges that a given vertex \(x\) is incident with is denoted \(E(x)\).
\end{notation}

\begin{notation}
  Let \(x, y \in V\). We denote the relation \((x, y) \in E\) as \(E(x, y)\)
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[Order and size]
  Let \(G\) be a graph. We define the \emph{order} of \(G\) as \(|G| =|V(G)|\),
  moreover, the \emph{size} of \(G\) is defined as \(\size{G} = |E(G)|\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Trivial graph]
  A graph \(G\) is said to be trivial if \(|G| \leq 1\). In the case of the
  \(0\) order, we denote the graph as \(\emptygraph\).
\end{definition}

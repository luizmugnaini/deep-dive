# Algebra Notes

These are my self-study algebra notes, currently they encompass:

* Category Theory
* Linear Algebra
* Group Theory

None of these subjects are completed (for obvious reasons). I don't know why I
keep these notes public, but if you happen to compile them and find them helpful
or stupid in some way (and if you're willing to help), reach me out and I'll be
quite happy to have some feedback.

In order to compile the notes you have to install
[Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/), which is the build
engine I'm currently using.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/luizmugnaini/algebra
$ cd algebra
$ tectonic -X build
```

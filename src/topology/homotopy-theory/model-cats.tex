\begin{definition}[Model category]
    \label{def:model-category}
    Let \(\mcat E\) be a category. We say that \(\mcat E\) has a \emph{model
        structure} if their morphisms are classified into three classes:
    \emph{fibrations} (denoted by the arrow \(\epi\)), \emph{cofibrations} (denoted
    by \(\mono\)), and \emph{weak equivalences} (denoted by \(\isoto\)), which
    satisfy the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item The category \(\mcat E\) is \emph{complete} and
              \emph{cocomplete}\footnote{Has all \emph{small} limits and colimits by
                  \cref{def:completeness-categories}.}.

        \item Given a commutative diagram
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      X \ar[rr, "f"] \ar[rd, "g"'] & &Z \\
                      &Y \ar[ru, "h"']
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              in \(\mcat E\), if \emph{any two} of the maps \(f\), \(g\) and \(h\) are weak
              equivalences, then the \emph{third} is a weak equivalence.

        \item If \(f\) is a retract---in the category \(\Mor(\mcat E)\)---of a morphism
              \(g\), and \(g\) is a weak equivalence, then \(f\) is also a weak
              equivalence. For a shorter punchline, the classes of fibrations and
              cofibrations is \emph{closed under retracts}.

        \item Given a commutative square
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      A \ar[r] \ar[d, tail, "j"'] &E \ar[d, two heads, "p"] \\
                      X \ar[ur, dotted] \ar[r] &B
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              in \(\mcat E\) where \(j\) is a cofibration and \(p\) is a fibration, the
              dotted morphism \(X \to E\) \emph{exists} when either \(j\) or \(p\) is a
              \emph{weak equivalence}. Said differently, fibrations have the \emph{right
                  lifting property} with respect to \emph{trivial cofibrations} (both a
              cofibration and a weak equivalence), while \emph{trivial fibrations} (both a
              fibration and a weak equivalence) have the \emph{right lifting property} with
              respect to cofibrations.

        \item Every morphism \(f: X \to Y\) can be factored as
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      X
                      \ar[rr, tail, "j"]
                      \ar[rrd, "f" description]
                      \ar[d, tail, "i"', "\dis"]
                      &&Y' \ar[d, two heads, "\dis"', "q"]
                      \\
                      X' \ar[rr, two heads, "p"']
                      &&Y
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              where \(j\) is a \emph{cofibration} and \(q\) is a \emph{trivial fibration} ,
              and \(i\) is a \emph{trivial cofibration} and \(p\) is a \emph{fibration}.
    \end{enumerate}
    The category \(\mcat E\) together with its model structure is said to be a
    \emph{model category}.

\section{Functors}

\begin{definition}[Functor]\label{def: functor}
Let \(\cat C\) and \(\cat D\) be categories. A functor \(F: \cat C \to \cat
D\) has the following data:
\begin{enumerate}[({DF}1)]
  \item For all \(c \in \cat C\) exists a corresponding \(F c \in \cat D\).
  \item For all \(f: c \to c' \in \Mor(\cat C)\) there exists a morphism \(F
    f: F c \to F c' \in \Mor(\cat D)\).
\end{enumerate}
Such data satisfies the two following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}[({AF}1)]
  \item For all composable \(f, g \in \Mor(\cat C)\), we have \(F g \cdot F f
    = F (g \cdot f)\).
  \item For all \(c \in \cat C\) we have \(F \Id_c = \Id_{F c} \in \Mor(\cat
    D)\).
\end{enumerate}
This definition is sometimes called covariant functor (in contrast with
contravariant functor, see \cref{def: contravariant functor}).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Forgetful functor]
A functor is said to be forgetful if the functor ``forgets'' some object,
structure or property of its domain category.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
We have some classical examples of forgetful functors, for instance, the
following are functors that forget the structure of their domain categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The functor \(G: \Grp \to \Set\) mapping groups to its
    corresponding underlying set.
  \item The functor \(T: \Top \to \Set\) maps any topological space
    to its corresponding set of points.
  \item The functor \(V, E: \Graph \to \Set\) maps the vertices and
    edges of a graph to the set of such vertices an edges.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Contravariant functor]
\label{def: contravariant functor}
A contravariant functor from categories \(\cat C\) to \(\cat D\) is a functor
\(F: \cat C^\op \to \cat D\) together with the following data:
\begin{enumerate}[({DCF}1)]
  \item For all \(c \in \cat C\) exists \(F c \in \cat D\).
  \item For all \(f: c \to c' \in \Mor(\cat C)\) we have \(F f: F c' \to F c
    \in \Mor(\cat D)\).
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, a contravariant functor satisfies the following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}[({ACF}1)]
  \item For all composable \(f, g \in \Mor(\cat C)\) we have \(F f \cdot F g =
    F (g \cdot f)\).
  \item For all \(c \in \cat C\) we have \(F \Id_c = \Id_{F c}\).
\end{enumerate}
This can all be comprised diagrammatically as:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \cat C^\op \ar[rr, "F"] & &\cat D
    \\
    c \ar[d, "f"] \ar[dd, bend right = 60, swap, "g f"]
    \ar[rr, mapsto]
    & &F c
    \\
    c' \ar[d, "g"] \ar[rr, mapsto]
    & &F c' \ar[u, "F f"]
    \\
    c'' \ar[rr, mapsto]
    & & F c''
    \ar[u, "F g"]
    \ar[uu, bend right = 60, swap, "F f \cdot F g = F (g \cdot f)"]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[\(\Top^\op \to \Rng\)]
Let \(C: \Top^\op \to \Rng\) be a contravariant functor such that
for all \(X \in \Top\), let \(C X\) be the ring of continuous functions
\(X \to \R\). The ring operations on \(C X\) are defined pointwise,
that is, given \(p, q: X \to \R \in C X\) we have \((p \cdot q) (x) =
p(x) \cdot q(x)\) and \((p + q)(x) = p(x) + q(x)\) for all \(x \in X\).
Moreover, given a morphism \(f: X \to Y \in \Mor(\Top)\) we define \(C f:
C Y \to C X\) as the composition \((C f)(q) = q f \in \Mor(C X)\) for all \(q
\in C Y\), that is
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \ar[r, "f"] \ar[rr, bend right = 40, swap, "C f(q) = q f"]
    & Y \ar[r, "q"] & \R
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

We now show that the axioms for the contravariant functor are satisfied by
\(C\). Let \(f: X \to Y\) and \(g: Y \to Z\), then given any \(p \in C Z\) we
have
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \ar[r, "f"]
    \ar[rrr, bend left = 60, "C f(C g (p))"]
    \ar[rrr, bend right, swap, "C (g f)(p)"]
    & Y \ar[r, "g"]
    \ar[rr, bend left = 35, "C g(p)"]
    & Z \ar[r, "p"] & \R
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
hence \(C (f) C (g) = C (g f)\). Moreover, given any \(X \in \Top^\op\)
we find that \(C \Id_X: C X \to C X\) is such that for all \(q \in C X\), \(C
\Id_X (q) = q \Id_X = q\) hence \(C \Id_X = \Id_{C X}\). This finishes the
proof that \(C: \Top^\op \to \Rng\) is a contravariant functor.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Presheaf]\label{def: presheaf}
Let \(\cat C\) be a small category. A contravariant functor \(\cat C^\op \to
\Set\) is called a presheaf on \(\cat C\).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[\(\mathcal O(X)^\op \to \Set\)]
Let \(X \in \Top\) we define \(\mathcal O(X)\) to be the poset category
whose objects are open sets of \(X\). That is, for sets \(U, U' \in \mathcal
O(X)\), if \(U \subseteq U'\), then there exists a morphism \(U \to U'\) in
\(\Mor(\mathcal O(X))\). A presheaf on the category \(\mathcal O(X)\) is a
functor \(F: \mathcal O(X)^\op \to \Set\) that assigns \(F U = \{f: U \to
\R: f \text{ continuous}\}\) for all \(U \in \mathcal O(X)\).
Moreover, for maps \(g: U \to U'\) (that is \(U \subseteq U'\)) we have \(F g:
F U' \to F U\) such that \(F g(f) = f|_U: U \to \R\) for all \(f: U'
\to \R\) continuous. Since the restriction of a continuous map is
continuous, then \(f|_U \in F U\)
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Simplex category]
\label{exp:simplex-category}
The simplex category \(\Delta\) comprises objects that are finite non-empty
ordinals and order-preserving morphisms. Simplicial sets are defined as
presheaves \(\Delta^{\op} \to \Set\).
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem: functor preserve iso}
Functors preserve isomorphisms. Let \(\cat C\) and \(\cat D\) be categories
and \(F: \cat C \to \cat D\) be a functor. Given an isomorphism \(f: c \isoto
c' \in \Mor(\cat C)\), we have that \(F f : F c \isoto c'\) is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Denote by \(f^{-1}: c' \isoto c\) the inverse of \(f\). By the composition
axiom we have
\begin{gather*}
  F (f^{-1}) F (f) = F (f^{-1} f) = F \Id_c    = \Id_{F c}, \\
  F (f) F (f^{-1}) = F (f f^{-1}) = F \Id_{c'} = \Id_{F c'}.
\end{gather*}
This shows that \(F f^{-1}\) is the right and left inverse of \(F f\), hence
\(F f: F c \isoto F c'\) is indeed an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[Group action]\label{exp:grp-action}
Let \(G\) be any group and consider the category \(\cat{B}G\) generated by \(G\)
--- that is, \(\cat BG\) consists of a unique object \(*\) and the morphisms of
the category are endomorphisms \(* \to *\) given by the elements of \(G\). Given
a category \(\cat C\), a functor \(X: \cat BG \to \cat C\) --- given by mapping
\(X* \coloneq X \in \cat C\) and each object \(g \in G\) to an endomorphism \(Xg
\coloneq g_{*}: X \to X\) --- is said to define a left group action on the
object \(X \in \cat C\). Moreover, the functor \(X\) has to obey
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Composition preserving: for any \(h, g \in G\), we have \((h g)_{*} =
  h_{*} g_{*}\).
\item Identity: \(e_{*} = \Id_X\).
\end{itemize}
Since functors preserve isomorphisms and every morphism of \(\cat BG\) is an
automorphism, it follows that, for all \(g \in G\), the map \(g_{*}: X \to X\)
is an automorphism --- in particular, this implies that \((g^{-1})_{*} =
g_{*}^{-1}\).

Some particular cases of interest are the following:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item If \(\cat C = \Set\), then the set \(X\) together with the actions
  \(\{g_{*} : g \in G\}\) is called a \(G\)-set.
\item If \(\cat C = \Vect_k\), then the \(k\)-vector space \(X\) together with
  the actions generated by \(G\) is said to be a \(G\)-representation.
\item If \(\cat C = \Top\), then the topological space \(X\) endowed with the
  actions generated by \(G\) is called a \(G\)-space.
\end{itemize}

A right group action is nothing more than a contravariant functor \(X: \cat
BG^{\op} \to \cat C\) such that \(X* \coloneq X\) and \(Xg \coloneq g^{*}: X \to
X\) are endomorphisms. The rules for such a functor are the contravariant
preservation of compositions, that is, \((h g)_{*} = g_{*} h_{*}\), and that
\(e^{*} = \Id_X\) as before.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem: func-preserve-split}
Functors preserve split monomorphisms and split epimorphisms.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\cat C\) and \(\cat D\) be categories and consider a functor \(F: \cat C
\to \cat D\). Define morphisms \(x \xrightarrow s y \xrightarrow r x\) in
\(\Mor(\cat C)\) such that \(r s = \Id_x\), that is, \(s\) is a split
monomorphism and \(r\) is a split epimorphism. Consider the morphisms \(F s: F
x \to F y\) and \(F r: F y \to F x\) in \(\Mor(\cat D)\). Notice that \(F (s)
F(r) = F(s r) = F(\Id_x) = \Id_{F x}\). Hence \(F s\) is a split monomorphism
and \(F r\) is a split epimorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[\(\Hom\) functors]\label{def:hom-functors}
Let \(\cat C\) be a locally small category. Given any \(c \in \cat C\), there
exists a pair of covariant and contravariant functors, \(\Hom(c, -)\) and
\(\Hom(-, c)\), respectively --- represented by the object \(c\). That is:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \cat C \ar[rr, "\Hom{(c, -)}"] & & \Set
    \\
    x \ar[rr, maps to] \ar[d, swap, "f"]
    & & \Hom(c, x) \ar[d, "f_*"]
    \\
    y \ar[rr, maps to] & & \Hom(c, y)
  \end{tikzcd}
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \cat C^\op \ar[rr, "\Hom{(-, c)}"] & & \Set
    \\
    x \ar[rr, maps to] \ar[d, swap, "f"]
    & & \Hom(x, c)
    \\
    y \ar[rr, maps to] & & \cat \Hom(y, c) \ar[u, swap, "f^*"]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{definition}

We now prove that such definition indeed satisfies the axioms for covariant and
contravariant functors. Given morphisms \(f: x \to y\) and \(g: y \to z\) in
\(\Mor(\cat C)\), we see that \(g_* f_* = (g f)_*\), moreover \(f^* g^* = (f
g)^*\). Let \(x \in \cat C\) be any object, then \(\Id_{x *} = \Id_{\Hom(c, x)}
= \Id_x^*\). This proves that \(\Hom(c, -)\) is covariant and \(\Hom(-, c)\) is
contravariant.

\begin{definition}[Faithful]\label{def: faithful}
Let \(\cat C\) and \(\cat D\) be categories. A functor \(F: \cat C \to \cat D\)
is said to be faithful if for all \(x, y \in \cat C\) the map \(\cat C(x, y) \to
\cat D(F x, F y)\) is injective.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Full]\label{def: full}
Let \(\cat C\) and \(\cat D\) be categories. A functor \(F: \cat C \to \cat D\)
is said to be full if for all \(x, y \in \cat C\) the map \(\cat C(x, y) \to
\cat D(F x, F y)\) is surjective.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Product category]\label{def:product-category}
Given categories \(\cat C\) and \(\cat D\), we define their product \(\cat C
\times \cat D\) to be a category whose objects are ordered pairs \((c, d)\) such
that \(c \in \cat C\) and \(d \in \cat D\), and morphisms are ordered pairs
\((f, g): (c, d) \to (c', d')\), where \(f: c \to c' \in \Mor(\cat C)\) and \(g:
d \to d' \in \Mor(\cat D)\). Composable morphisms \((f, g)\) and \((h, q)\) have
composition defined componentwise, that is, \((f, g) (h, q) = (fh, gq)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Two sided represented functor]
\label{def:two-sided-represented-functor}
Let \(\cat C\) be a locally small category, then there is a functor \(\Hom(-,
-): \cat C^{\op} \times \cat C \to \Set\) defined by mapping objects \((x, y)
\mapsto \Hom(x, y)\) and morphisms \((f, g): (a, y) \to (x, b)\) to a
set-function \((f^{*}, g_{*}): \Hom(x, y) \to \Hom(a, b)\) given by the mapping
\(g \mapsto h g f\).
\end{definition}

Categories also form a category, whose objects are categories and morphisms are
functors between them --- but this gives rise to size \todo{describe}issues, so
we have to distinguish between two kinds of categories, the ones that are
\emph{small} and \emph{locally small}. This gives rise to two categories,
\(\Cat\) and \(\CAT\), comprised of objects that are small and locally small,
respectively.

\begin{definition}[Isomorphism of categories]
\label{def:isomorphism-categories}
Let \(\cat C\) and \(\cat D\) be categories. We say that \(\cat C\) is
isomorphic to \(\cat D\) if there exists morphisms \(F: \cat C \to \cat D\) and
\(G: \cat D \to \cat C\) such that \(GF = \Id_{\cat C}\) and \(FG = \Id_{\cat D}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Orbit category]
\label{exp:orbit-category}
Let \(G\) be a group. We define the orbit category associated to \(G\) as
\(\mathcal{O}_G\) whose objects are subgroups \(H \subseteq G\), identified by
the left \(G\)-set \(G/H\) of left costs of \(H\). The morphisms \(\phi: G/H \to
G/Q\) are maps commuting with the left \(G\)-action, that is, \(\phi(g_{*}h) =
g_{*} \phi(h)\) --- such maps are called \(G\)-equivariant.
\end{example}

\section{Connected Spaces}

\begin{definition}[Connected space]
\label{def:connected-space}
Let \(X\) be a topological space. We say that \(X\) is \emph{connected} if and
only if one of the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item The space \(X\) cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint non-empty
open sets.
\item Every morphism \(f: X \to \{0, 1\}\) is constant --- where \(\{0, 1\}\) is
a space endowed with the discrete topology.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
The two conditions in \cref{def:connected-space} are equivalent.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Assume \(X\) satisfies the condition (a), and let \(x \in X\) be any
point. Suppose \(f(x) = 0\) (or \(f(x) = 1\), we do not loose generality by
choosing a point of the domain), and consider \(f^{-1}(0) \subseteq X\), which
must be open from the continuity of \(f\), thus \(f^{-1}(0)\) is a neighbourhood
of \(x\) in \(X\). If we suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there
exists \(y \in X\) such that \(f(y) = 1\), then \(f^{-1}(1)\) is also open and
is a neighbourhood of \(y\) --- notice however that \(f^{-1}(0) \cap f^{-1}(1) =
\emptyset\), thus we arrive at a contradiction, there must be no point \(y\)
with image different than zero.

We prove the counter positive: not (b) implies not (a). Suppose \(f: X
\to \{0, 1\}\) is not constant, so that there exists two points \(x, y \in X\)
such that \(f(x) = 0\) and \(f(y) = 1\) (and therefore \(f\) is surjective),
notice however that, since \(f\) is continous,
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Connected components]
\label{def:connected-components}
Let \(X\) be a topological space. Define an equivalence relation \(\sim\) by,
given \(x, y \in X\), we have \(x \sim y\) if and only if there exists a
connected subspace of \(X\) containing both \(x\) and \(y\). The collection of
equivalence classes \(X/{\sim}\) is called \emph{connected components} of \(X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Totally disconnected]
\label{def:totally-disconnected}
A space is said to be totally disconnected if the only connected subsets are
singletons.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{exp:Q-is-totally-disconnected}
The set of rational numbers \(\Q\) is totally disconnected.
\end{example}

\begin{notation}[Standard interval]
From now on, when talking about \emph{paths} and \emph{homotopies}, we shall
reserve the symbol \(I\) to denote the \emph{standard topological interval},
which is defined by
\[
  I \coloneq [0, 1] \subseteq \R.
\]
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[Paths \& loops]
\label{def:path-loop}
A \emph{path} in a topological space \(X\) is any continuous map \(\gamma: I \to
X\). A \emph{loop} in \(X\) is a continuous map \(\ell: I \to X\) such that
\(\ell(0) = \ell(1)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Path connected space]
\label{def:path-connected}
A topological space \(X\) is said to be \emph{path connected} if and only if
for all \(x, y \in X\) there exists a \emph{path} connecting \(x\) and \(y\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Path connected equivalence relation]
\label{prop:path-connected-equiv-relation}
There exists an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on the topological \(X\) defined
by: given \(x, y \in X\), we have \(x \sim y\) if and only if there exists a
path in \(X\) connecting \(x\) and \(y\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The constant path \(x: I \to X\) given by \(t \mapsto x\) is a path on
\(X\), thus \(x \sim x\). Let \(x \sim y\) and \(\gamma\) be a path from
\(\gamma(0) = x\) to \(\gamma(1) = y\), then we can define a map \(\lambda: [0,
1] \to X\) given by \(\lambda(t) \coloneq \gamma(1 - t)\), so that \(\lambda\)
is both continuous, and \(\lambda(0) = y\) while \(\lambda(1) = x\) --- thus
\(\lambda\) is a path between \(y\) and \(x\), therefore \(y \sim x\). Suppose
now \(y \sim z\) and let \(\eta\) be a path connecting \(y\) to \(z\). We
define a map \(\phi: I \to X\) given by
\[
  \phi(t) \coloneq
  \begin{cases}
    \lambda(2t), &\text{ for } t \in [0, 1/2] \\
    \eta(2t - 1), &\text{ for } t \in [1/2, 1]
  \end{cases}
\]
which is surely continuous and connects both \(x\) and \(z\) --- thus \(x \sim
z\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Path connected components]
\label{def:path-connected-components}
Let \(X\) be a path connected topological space, and \(\sim\) be the equivalence
relation described in \cref{prop:path-connected-equiv-relation}. The collection
\(X/{\sim}\) is called the \emph{path connected components} of the space
\(X\). We denote the collection of all path components of \(X\) by \(\pi_0(X)\)
--- the collection of homotopy classes between maps \(* \to X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[\(\pi_0\) functor]
\label{def:pi0-functor}
The concept of connected components of a space induce a covariant functor
\(\pi_0: \Top \to \Set\) defined by mapping objects \(X \mapsto \pi_0 X\), and
morphisms \(f: X \to Y\) to \(\pi_0 f: \pi_0 X \to \pi_0 Y\) --- which is a well
defined map since, given a path component \(P\) of \(X\), the set \(f(X)
\subseteq Y\) is connected and therefore contained in a unique path component of
\(Y\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Morphisms preserve connectivity]
\label{thm:morphisms-preserve-connectivity}
Let \(X\) be a (path) connected space and \(f: X \to Y\) be a topological
morphism. Then \(f(X) \subseteq Y\) is (path) connected.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that \(f(X)\) is not connected, and let \(g: f(X) \to \{0, 1\}\) be a
non-constant morphism --- in particular, this is equivalent to the condition of
\(gf: X \to \{0, 1\}\) being a non-constant morphism, thus implying in the
non-connectedness of \(X\).

On the other hand, assume now that \(X\) is path connected and let \(u, v \in
f(X)\) --- define \(x, y \in X\) so that \(f(x) = u\) and \(f(y) = v\). Let
\(\gamma: I \to X\) be a path connecting \(x\) and \(y\) --- then \(f\gamma: I
\to f(X)\) is a path connecting \(u\) and \(v\), which proves the proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:connectedness-top-property}
Connectedness and path connectedness are both topological properties.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:quotient-path-connected-is-path-connected}
The quotient of a (path) connected topological space is (path) connected.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:connectivity-quotients}
Let \(f: X \epi Y\) be a morphism of topological spaces \(X\) and \(Y\). If
\(Y\) is connected and, for all \(y \in Y\), the fiber \(f^{-1}(y)\) is
connected, then \(X\) is connected.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(g: X \to \{0, 1\}\) be a morphism. From the connectedness condition on the
fibers of \(f\), it follows that \(g\) must be constant throughout the fibers of
\(f\) --- this implies in the existence of a morphism \(g^{*}: Y \to \{0, 1\}\)
such that \(g = g^{*} f\). Since \(Y\) is connected, \(g^{*}\) must be constant,
therefore the composition \(g^{*} f\) is constant and so is \(g\) --- that is,
\(X\) is connected.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:union-path-connected}
Let \(J\) be an indexing set associated to a collection \(\{X_{j}\}_{j \in J}\)
of (path) connected topological spaces. Define the space \(X \coloneq \bigcup_{j
\in J} X_j\). If the intersection \(\bigcap_{j \in J} X_j\) is non-empty, then
\(X\) is (path) connected.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Suppose the intersection is non empty and let \(x \in \bigcup_{j \in J}
X_j\) be any point. We split the proposition into the two given cases.

Suppose \(X_j\) is connected for all \(j \in J\). Let \(f: X \to \{0, 1\}\) be a
morphism --- we want to show that it has to be constant. Since \(X_j\) is
connected, it follows tha the restriction \(f|_{X_j}\) has to be constant, and,
since \(x \in X_j\), then \(f(x) = f(y)\) for all \(y \in X_j\). The fact that
this must be true for all \(X_j\) shows that \(f\) must be constant throughout
the whole set \(X\).

Suppose \(X_j\) is path connected for all \(j \in J\) --- that is, from
hypothesis, \(X_j\) is a path connected component of \(X\). We now prove that
the intersection is connected to each of the path connected components. For each
\(j \in J\), choose any point \(y \in X_j\). Since \(x \in X_j\), then \(x \sim
y\) and therefore every point of \(X\) is connected by a path.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:connected-interval-real-space}
In the real space \(\R\), the only connected sets are intervals.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If \(A\) is not an interval, there must exist a pair \(x, y \in A\) for which
there is \(z \notin A\) with \(x < z < y\). This way, we can write \(A\) as the
union of two disjoint non-empty sets: \(A = [A \cap (-\infty, z)] \cup [A \cap
(z, \infty)]\) --- that is, \(A\) is disconnected.

We now show that intervals are connected. For the sake of contradiction, assume
there exists an interval \(I\) such that there are disjoint and non-empty sets
\(A\) and \(B\) for which \(I = A \cup B\) --- that is, we assume \(I\) is
disconnected. Let \(x, y \in I\) be any two elements with \(x < y\) and \(x \in
A\), while \(y \in B\). By the archimedian principle, valid in \(\R\), since the
set \(C \coloneq [x, y) \cap A\) is both non-empty and bounded above, thus \(C\)
has a supremum, let \(s \coloneq \sup C\) --- where \(x < s \leq y\). Notice
that \(s \notin A\), since if so then \(s\) would not be the supremum of \(C\),
therefore \(s \in B\) --- which also cannot be the case, since \(s\) would not,
again, be the supremum of \(C\). We conclude that the sets \(A\) and \(B\)
cannot be constructed at all, hence there is no disconnected interval in \(\R\).
\end{proof}

\section{Compact Spaces}

\begin{definition}[Compact space]
\label{def:compact-space}
A topological space \(X\) is said to be \emph{compact} if for \emph{every} open
cover there exists a \emph{finite subcover}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Sequentially compact space]
\label{def:sequentially-compact}
A topological space \(X\) is said to be \emph{sequentially compact} if every
sequence of points \((x_j)_j\) in \(X\), there exists a subsequence \((x_j')_j
\subseteq (x_j)_j\) that converges in \(X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Metric space compactness]
\label{prop:metric-space-compactness-equivalences}
Compactness, limit point compactness, and sequential compactness are
\emph{equivalent} in \emph{metric spaces}.
\end{proposition}

\todo[inline]{Prove metric compactness and expand section}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:hausdorff-compact-implies-closed}
Let \(X\) be a Hausdorff space. If \(A \subseteq X\) is compact then \(A\) is
closed in \(X\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(x_0 \in A'\) be any limit point of \(A\). We suppose, for the sake of
contradiction, that \(x_0 \notin A\). Since \(X\) is Hausdorff, for every \(x
\in A\) we let \(U_x\) be a neighbourhood of \(x\) such that there exists a
neighbourhood of \(x_0\) that is disjoint from \(U_x\). Define now the
collection \(\mathcal{U} \coloneq \{U_x : x \in A\}\) --- thus clearly
\(\mathcal{U}\) covers \(A\) since it contains every point of \(A\), this being
possible because we assumed that \(x_0\) does not belong to \(A\). Since \(A\)
is compact, we let \(\mathcal{C} \coloneq \{U_{x_1}, \dots, U_{x_n}\} \subseteq
\mathcal{U}\) be a finite subcover. Define \(\mathcal{O} \coloneq \{O_1, \dots,
O_n\}\) of neighbourhoods of \(x_0\) such that \(U_{x_j} \cap O_j = \emptyset\)
for all \(1 \leq j \leq n\) --- thus \(U_{x_j} \cap \bigcap_{j=1}^n O_j =
\emptyset\), and therefore \(A \cap \bigcap_{j=1}^n O_j = \emptyset\) which by
\cref{def:limit-point-derived-set} implies that \(x_0\) cannot be a limit point
of \(A\), thus we arrived at a contradiction. Therefore, for \(x_0\) to be a
limit point of \(A\), it must be the case that \(x_0 \in A\), that is, \(A\) is
closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:metric-space-compact-implies-bounded-closed}
In any metric space \(X\), if \(A \subseteq X\) is \emph{compact} then \(A\) is
both \emph{bounded} and \emph{closed} in \(X\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Since every metric space is Hausdorff, \(A\) is closed by
\cref{prop:hausdorff-compact-implies-closed}. Moreover, if \(x \in A\) is any
point, we find that the collection of open balls \(\mathcal{B}_x \coloneq
\{B_x(n)\}_{n \in \N}\) forms an open cover of \(A\) and, since \(A\) is
compact, there exists a finite subcover of \(\mathcal{B}_x\). Therefore there
exists a maximal \(m \in \N\) for which \(A \subseteq B_x(m)\) --- thus \(A\) is
bounded.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem:closed-and-bounded-not-compact}
Notice that a bounded and closed set in a metric space does \emph{not} need to
be compact, for instance, consider the space \(\ell^2(\N)\) (see
\cref{exp:p-norms}) and the subset \(A \coloneq \{f_n\}_{n \in \N}\) composed of
sequences \(f_n \in \ell^2(\N)\) such that \(f_n(j) \coloneq \delta_{n j}\) ---
that is, sequences where the only nonzero term is the \(n\)-th one, which equals
\(1\). Clearly \(A\) is bounded since \(\| f_{n} \|_2 = 1\), moreover, \(A\) is
closed because it has no limit points. However, since no subset of \(A\)
contains a limit point of \(A\), we find that \(A\) is not limit point compact
--- thus not compact (see \cref{prop:metric-space-compactness-equivalences})
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:convergent-subsequence-implies-compact}
Let \(X\) be a metric space and \(A \subseteq X\) be a subset. Then, \(A\) is
compact if and only if every sequence of points in \(A\) has a convergent
subsequence in \(A\).

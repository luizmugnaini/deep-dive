\section{The Simple Loopless Graph}

Sometimes (and by that I mean almost always) graph theorists like the incidence
relation be irreflexive --- loops are therefore forbidden, that is, \(E(x, x)\)
is always false for any \(x \in V\) ---, but this construction does not get us a
good category. We are going to reserve the word ``simple graph" to mean a simple
graph with loops and the word ``graph" for simple graphs with no loops. The
following is a formal definition of a loopless simple graph --- a ``graph".

\begin{definition}[Graph]\label{def: graph}
  \(G = (V, E, d)\) is said to be a graph if
  \[
    d: E \to \langle V \rangle^2 \text{, mapping } e \xmapsto d (x, y) = (y, x)
    \text{ and } x \neq y.
  \]
  That is, \(E(x, y)\) if and only if \(E(y, x)\), and \(E(x, x)\) is always
  false.
\end{definition}

From now on we are mostly going to assume the existence of the incidence
relation map \(d\) (symmetric and irreflexive) and simply denote a graph \(G\)
by \((V, E)\) --- where we assume that \(G\) is a simple loopless graph.

\begin{definition}[Morphism of graphs]\label{def: graph-morph}
  Let \(G = (V, E)\) and \(H = (V', E')\) be graphs. A morphism \(G \to H\) is a
  map \(\varphi: V \to V'\) such that \(E(x, y)\) implies \(E(\varphi(x),
  \varphi(y))\) --- that is, adjacency of vertices need to be preserved.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Graph category]\label{def: graph-cat}
  We define the category of simple loopless graphs, denoted by \(\Graph\), as
  the category with graph objects and morphisms of graphs.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Stable preimage]\label{lem: stable-preimage}
  Let \(\varphi: G \to H\) be a morphism of graphs, then, for any \(x' \in
  V(H)\), the collection \(\varphi^{-1}(x') \subseteq V(G)\) is stable in \(G\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose, for the sake of contradition, that there exists vertices \(x, y \in
  \varphi^{-1}(x)\) such that \(E(x, y)\) is true in \(G\). In particular, this
  implies that \(E(\varphi(x), \varphi(y)) = E(x', x')\) is true in \(H\), which
  is forbidden --- hence there can be no such pair of vertices in
  \(\varphi^{-1}(x')\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Graph property]\label{def: graph-property}
  A class of graphs is said to be a property of graphs if it is closed up to
  isomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Graph invariant]\label{def: graph-invariant}
  A map \(\phi: \Graph \to S\) --- where \(S \in \Set\), possibly \(\R\) for
  instance --- is said to be a graph invariant if for all \(G, G' \in
  \Graph\) such that \(G \iso G'\) then
  \[
    \phi(G) = \phi(G').
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Union and intersections]\label{def: union-intersection-gph}
  Let \(G = (V, E), G' = (V', E') \in \Graph\). We define their union as the
  graph
  \[
    G \cup G' = (V \cup V', E \cup E').
  \]
  Analogously, their intersection is defined as
  \[
    G \cap G' = (V \cap V', E \cap E').
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Complete Graph]\label{def: complete-graph}
  A graph \(G\) is said to be complete if for all pairs of vertices \(x, y \in
  G\), \(E(x, y)\) is true.
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}
  We denote by \(K^n\) the complete graph on \(n\) vertices.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[Subgraph]
  Let \(G = (V, E)\) and \(G' = (V', E')\) be graphs. \(G'\) is said to be a
  \emph{subgraph} of \(G\) --- denoted \(G' \subseteq G\) --- if \(V' \subseteq
  V\) and \(E' \subseteq E\). On the other hand, \(G\) is said to be a
  \emph{supergraph} of \(G'\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Induced subgraph]
  Let \(G' = (V', E')\) be a subgraph of \(G\). \(G'\) is said to be an
  \emph{induced subgraph} of \(G\) if for all \(x, y \in V\), then \(E_{G'}(x,
  y)\) if \(E_G(x, y)\). We denote \(G' = G[V']\). If \(G[V'] = G\), then we say
  that \(G'\) is a \emph{spanning subgraph} of \(G\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Embedding of graphs]\label{def: graph-embedding}
  Let \(G\) and \(H\) be graphs. A morphism of graphs \(\iota: H \mono G\) is
  said to be an embedding of \(H\) into \(G\) if its underlying map \(V(H) \mono
  V(G)\) is injective.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Deletion vertices or edges]
  \label{def: deletion-graph}
  Let \(G = (V, E)\) be a graph and \(V' \subseteq V\) a subset of the
  vertices of \(G\). The deletion of the parts of \(G\) associated with the
  vertices \(V'\) is defined as the graph \(G[V \setminus V']\) --- which we'll
  shortly identify as \(G \setminus V'\). Equivalently we define the deletion
  of edges \(E' \subseteq E\) as the graph \(G - E' := (V, E \setminus E')\).
\end{definition}

Notice that the non-connected vertices are not deleted from the resulting graph
\(G \setminus E'\), contrary to the case of the deletion of vertices \(G
\setminus V'\), where edges with endpoints out of \(V'\) where removed.

\begin{definition}[Edge-maximal]
  \label{def: edge-maximal}
  Given a graph property \(P\), a graph \(G = (V, E)\) is said to be
  \emph{edge-maximal} with respect to \(P\) if \(G \in P\) and for all \(E'
  \supsetneq E\) the graph \((V, E')\) does not have the property \(P\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Clique]\label{def: clique}
  Let \(G\) be a graph and \(S \subseteq V(G)\) be a subset with \(k\) vertices.
  If the graph \(G[S]\) is complete, we call it a \(k\)-clique. Trivially,
  \(G[S] \iso K_k\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Complement graph]\label{def: complement-graph}
  Given a graph \(G = (V, E)\), the complement of \(G\) is defined as the graph
  \(\overline G = (V, \langle V \rangle^2 \setminus E)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Line graph]\label{def: line-graph}
  Given a graph \(G\), the line graph of \(G\), denoted by \(L(G)\), is the
  graph such that, if \(e = (x, y), e' = (y, z) \in E(G)\) are adjacent edges
  then \(E_{L(G)}(x, z)\) --- that is \(L(G) = (V(G), E)\) where
  \[
    E = \{(x, z) \in \langle V \rangle^2 : E_G(x, y) \text{ and } E_G(y, z)
    \text{ for some } y \in V(G)\}.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Join]\label{def: graph-join}
  Let \(G = (V, E), G' = (V', E') \in \Graph\) be disjoint --- \(G \cap G' =
  \emptyset\). We define their join as the graph \(G * G'\) with vertices \(V
  \cup V'\) and edges \(E \cup E' \cup E^*\), where \(E^*\) is defined as \(E^*
  = \{(x, y) : x \in G, y \in G'\}\) --- that is, the collection of all edges
  connecting the vertices of \(G\) and \(G'\).
\end{definition}

The join definition fails to be a coproduct in the category of graphs exactly
because of the addition of the \(E^*\) edges --- the edges between elements of
\(G\) with \(G'\) in \(G * G'\) cannot be ensured to be preserved by a morphism
\(G * G' \to H\) as described in \cref{prop: coprod-graph}.

\subsection{Vertex Degree}

\begin{notation}[Neighbourhood]
  Given a graph \(G\), we denote by \(N(v)\) the collection of all neighbours of
  \(v \in G\).
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[Degree]\label{def: degree}
  Let \(G\) be a graph, we define the degree (or valency) of a vertex \(v \in
  G\) as \(\deg v = |N(v)|\). If \(G\) is a finite graph,
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item The minimum degree of \(G\) is defined as \(\delta(G) = \min_{v \in
      V(G)} \deg v\).
    \item The maximum degree of \(G\) is defined as \(\Delta(G) = \max_{v \in
      V(G)} \deg v\).
    \item The average degree of \(G\) is defined as
      \[
        \deg G = \frac 1 {|G|} \sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg v.
      \]
    \item The edge-vertex ratio of \(G\) is \(\epsilon(G) =
      \frac{\size{G}}{|G|}\). Since an edge is composed of two vertices, the sum
      \(\sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg v\) counts every edge exactly twice, so that
      \(\epsilon(G) = \frac 1 2 \sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg v\). Thus we arrive in
      the relation \(\epsilon(G) = \frac 1 2 \deg G\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem: handshaking}
  The number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is even.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(G\) be a graph. Since \(\size G \in \N\) and \(\size G = \frac 1 2
  \sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg v\), then \(\sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg v\) is even. If the
  number of odd degree vertices where odd, then the sum of their degrees would
  also be odd. Since the sum of even degree vertices is always even, it is
  necessary for the number of odd degree vertices to be even.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Edge-dense subgraph]\label{prop: edge-dense-subgraph}
  Let \(G\) be a finite graph with size \(\size G \geq 1\). Then there exists a
  subgraph \(H \subseteq G\) such that
  \[
    \delta(H) > \epsilon(H) \geq \epsilon(G).
  \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We'll construct the subgraph \(H\) by means of a chain of consequent single
  vertex deletion --- as in \cref{def: deletion-graph}. Let \(H_0 = G\) Notice
  that, if we want to have the edge-vertex ratio unaltered (or increased) by the
  deletion, we got to choose a vertex \(v \in H_0\) --- if existent --- such
  that the graph \(H_1 = H_0 \setminus v\) has \(\epsilon(H_1) \geq
  \epsilon(H_0)\), that is, \(\deg v\) has to satisfy
  \[
    \epsilon(H_1) = \frac{\size{H_0} - \deg v}{|H_0| - 1}
    \geq \frac{\size{H_0}}{|H_0|} = \epsilon(H_0).
  \]
  Solving the above equation for the degree of \(v\), we find that \(\deg v \leq
  \epsilon(H_0)\). Since \(\delta(H_0) \leq \deg H_0 \leq \Delta(H_0)\) and
  \(\epsilon(H_0) \leq \deg H_0\), then \(\deg v \leq \Delta(H_0)\) --- that is,
  \(\delta(H_1) \leq \delta(H_0)\). If such vertex doesn't exists in \(V(H_0)\),
  we terminate our algorithm and find \(H = H_0 = G\). Otherwise, we continue
  recursively, generating a finite chain of subgraphs --- the finiteness of the
  chain comes from the fact that \(G\) itself is finite
  \[
    G = H_0 \supset H_1 \supset H_2 \supset \dots \supset H_n = H
  \]
  for some \(n \in \N\). Where \(\epsilon(H_{j+1}) \geq \epsilon(H_j)\) and
  \(\delta(H_{j+1}) \geq \delta(H_j)\) for all \(0 \leq j < n\). At some point
  the chain will terminate into the subgraph \(H\). Moreover, since the
  recursion terminates in \(H \neq \emptygraph\), then necessarily \(\deg v >
  \epsilon(H)\) for all \(v \in H\) --- in particular, this implies in
  \(\delta(H) > \epsilon(H)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Regular graph]\label{def: k-regular}
  A graph \(G\) is said to be \(k\)-regular --- for some \(k \in \N\) --- if
  \(\deg v = k\) for all \(v \in G\).
\end{definition}

\section{Path to Glory}

\begin{definition}[Walk]\label{def: walk}
  A walk on a graph \(G\) is defined to be a subgraph \(W \subseteq G\) ---
  assume \(|W| = n + 1\) for some \(n \in \N\) --- such that there exists a
  \emph{surjective map} \(\ell: [n] \epi V(W)\) satisfying the
  condition of \(E_G(\ell(k), \ell(k + 1))\) for all \(0 \leq k < n\). We'll
  generally assume this underlying surjective vertex-labelling map and denote
  \(W = (\ell(0), \dots, \ell(n)) = (v_0, \dots, v_n)\). The walk \(W\) is said
  to be closed if \(v_0 = v_n\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Length]\label{def: walk-length}
  We define the length of a walk \(W\) to be its size \(\size W\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Walk operations]\label{def: walk-operations}
  Given a path \(W = (v_0, \dots, v_n)\) we can define the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.0em}
    \item (Subwalk) Let \(v_j \in V(W)\) be any vertex. We define a subwalk of
      \(W\) restricted to \(v_j\) to be one of the following subgraphs of \(W\):
      \(v_jW = (v_j, v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n)\) and \(Wv_j = (v_0, \dots, v_{j-1},
      v_j)\). We can also define excluding subwalk induced by \(v_j\) to be
      \(\breve v_j W = (v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n)\) and \(W \breve v_j = (v_0, \dots,
      v_{j-1})\).
    \item (Inner walk) The inner walk of \(W\) is given by \(\breve W = (v_1,
      \dots, v_{n-1})\).
    \item (Walk concatenation) Let \(Q = (w_0, \dots, w_m)\) be a walk.
      If \(P\) and \(Q\) have coinciding endings, say \(v_n = w_0 = x\), we can
      define the concatenation of \(P\) with \(Q\) to be the walk \(PQ = (v_0,
      \dots, v_{n-1}, x, w_1, \dots, w_m)\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Path]\label{def: path}
  We define a path to be walk with no repeating vertices. A path graph \(P_n\)
  is a graph of order \(n + 1\) and size \(n\) such that there exists a
  \emph{bijective map} \(\ell_n: [n] \isoto V(P_n)\) for which
  \(E_{P_n}(\ell_n(k), \ell_n(k+1))\) for all \(0 \leq k < n\). We'll usually
  assume the existence of the underlying vertex-labelling bijection \(\ell_n\).
  This way we can naturally write the path \(P_n\) as a unique sequence of
  vertices \((v_0, v_1, \dots, v_n)\) \emph{up to isomorphism} of graphs.

  Given a graph \(G\), we define a path of size \(n + 1\) \emph{on} \(G\) to be
  the \emph{induced subgraph} of \(G\) given by \(G[\iota(P_n)]\), where
  \(\iota: P_n \mono G\) is an \emph{embedding of graphs} --- see \cref{def:
  graph-embedding}. The underlying labelling is now given by the composition
  \(\iota \ell_n: [n] \to V(G)\).
\end{definition}

Since a path is just a special type of walk, every operation described on
\cref{def: walk-operations} is carried over to the path graphs.

\begin{proposition}[Transforming paths into walks]
  \label{prop: morphism-path-walk}
  A map \(\phi: P_n \to G\) is a morphism of graphs if and only if the sequence
  \((\phi(v_0), \dots, \phi(v_n))\) is a walk on \(G\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Throughout, assume \(0 \leq j < n\). If \(\phi\) is a morphism of graphs then
  \(E_{P_n}(v_j, v_{j + 1})\) implies \(E_G(\phi(v_j), \phi(v_{j+1}))\) thus
  inducing a walk on \(G\). On the other hand, if \((\phi(v_0), \dots,
  \phi(v_n))\) is a walk on \(G\), then since the only edges on \(P_n\) occur
  between consequent vertices \(v_j\) and \(v_{j+1}\), we have that \(\phi\)
  indeed preserves the adjacency structure of the path \(P_n\), that is,
  \(E_{P_n}(v_j, v_{j+1})\) implies \(E_G(\phi(v_j), \phi(v_{j+1}))\) --- hence
  \(\phi\) is a morphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Paths on walks]\label{lem: paths-on-walks}
  Let \(W\) be a walk. If \(x, y \in V(W)\), then there exists a path \(P
  \subseteq W\) such that \(x, y \in V(P)\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Assume \(W\) is a \(k\)-walk and contains \(x\) and \(y\) at its endvertices
  --- if not, we would be analogously analysing the subwalk \(xWy\). Let \(\ell:
  [k] \epi V(W)\) be a surjective labelling on \(W\) --- since \(x\) and \(y\)
  are endvertices, we have
  \begin{equation}\label{eq: paths-on-walks-1}
    \ell(0) = x\ \text{ and }\ \ell(k) = y.
  \end{equation}
  Let \(\mathcal C\) be the
  collection of all cycles on \(W\) --- refer to \cref{def: cycle}. Define the
  equivalence relation \(\sim\) on the vertices \(V(W)\) to be so that \(v \sim
  u\) if and only if \(v, u \in V(C)\) for some \(C \in \mathcal C\).

  The quotient graph \(W/\sim\) (see \cref{def: quotient-graph}) is a path
  joining the vertex classes \(\overline x\) and \(\overline y\). To see that,
  we can first construct an equivalence relation \(\sim_\ell\) on the indexing
  set \([k]\), defined as follows: \(i \sim_\ell j\) if and only if \(\ell(i)
  \sim \ell(j)\) --- clearly \([k]/\sim_\ell\) is an indexing set for the
  vertices of the quotient graph. Lets assume that \([k]/\sim_\ell\, =
  \{\overline 0, \dots, \overline m\}\). Let \(\ell': [k]/\sim_\ell\, \to
  V(W/\sim)\) be a labelling on \(W/\sim\) defined as \(\ell'(\overline j) =
  \overline{\ell(j)}\). Using \cref{eq: paths-on-walks-1}, the sequence of
  vertices \((\ell'(\overline 0), \dots, \ell'(\overline m)\) is such that
  \(\ell'(\overline 0) = \overline x\) and \(\ell'(\overline m) = \overline y\).
  Also, \(E_{W/\sim}(\ell'(\overline j), \ell'(\overline{j + 1})) = E_W(\ell(j),
  \ell(j+1))\) is always true (because \(W\) is a walk). So far, we've shown
  that \(W/\sim\) is a walk between \(\overline x\) and \(\overline y\) --- we
  now need to show that no vertex is repeated in the given labelled sequence,
  which is actually trivial. Suppose that \(\ell'(\overline i) = \ell'(\overline
  j)\), then from definition of \(\ell'\) we have \(\overline{\ell(i)} =
  \overline{\ell(j)}\), which implies that \(\ell(i) \sim \ell(j)\) and hence
  \(i \sim_\ell j\) --- thus \(\overline i = \overline j\). This shows that
  \[
    W/\sim\ = (\overline x, \ell'(\overline 1), \dots, \ell'(\overline{m - 1}),
    \overline y)
  \]
  is indeed a path joining \(\overline x\) and \(\overline y\).

  For the last part we just need to consider the embedding of graphs \(\iota:
  W/\sim\ \mono W\) such that \(E_{W/\sim}(\overline v, \overline u)\) implies
  \(E_W(\iota(\overline v), \iota(\overline u))\). The sequence of vertices
  \[
    \iota(W/\sim) \coloneqq (\iota(\overline x), \iota\ell'(\overline 1), \dots,
    \iota \ell'(\overline{m-1}), \iota(\overline y)) \subseteq W
  \]
  is clearly a path on \(W\) joining the vertices \(\iota(\overline x) = x\) and
  \(\iota(\overline y) = y\). Hence, \(P = W[\im \iota]\) gives us the wanted
  path --- finally the proposition is proved.
\end{proof}

The last proof may got really clumsy at some points, so here goes an example of
the basic operations we've developed and used throughout the proof. Let \(W =
(x, v_1, \dots, v_{12}, y)\) be a walk, visually given by --- where \(v_5 =
v_2\) and \(v_{11} = v_6\)
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[%
    , cells={nodes={circle, draw, inner sep=1.5pt}}
    , every arrow/.append style={dash,thick}
    , row sep=tiny
    , column sep=tiny
    ]
    % 1 line
              &v_4 \ar[rr] \ar[dr] & &v_3 \ar[dl] & &
    \\
    % 2 line
    x \ar[dr] & &v_2 \ar[dl] \ar[dr] & &v_{12} \ar[dr] &
    \\
    % 3 line
              &v_1 & &v_6 \ar[ur] \ar[dl] \ar[dr] & &y
    \\
    % 4 line
              & &v_{10} \ar[d] & &v_7 \ar[d] &
    \\
    % 5 line
              & &v_9 \ar[rr] & &v_8 &
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
Now, the process of taking the quotient of the graph amounts to the
identification of the cycles
\[
  \mathcal C = \{W[\{v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\}],\,
  W[\{v_6, v_7, v_8, v_9, v_{10}, v_{11}\}]\}
\]
The cycles are respectively reduced to classes \(\overline v_2\) and \(\overline
v_3\), both elements of \(V(W)/\sim\). The quotient graph \(W/\sim\) can be
visually depicted as follows
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[%
    , cells={nodes={circle, draw, inner sep=1.5pt}}
    , every arrow/.append style={dash,thick}
    , row sep=tiny
    , column sep=tiny
    ]
    % 1 line
    \overline x \ar[dr]
    & &\overline v_2 \ar[dl] \ar[dr] & &\overline v_4 \ar[dl] \ar[dr] &
    \\
    &\overline v_1 & &\overline v_3 & &y
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
Now for the embedding of graphs \(\iota: W/\sim\, \mono W\), we can view \(P =
W[\im\iota]\) as the subgraph consisting of the red edges and their endvertices
--- that is, the collection of vertices \(\{x, v_1, v_2, v_6, v_{12}, y\}\) ---
which can be visualised as follows
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[%
    , cells={nodes={circle, draw, inner sep=1.5pt}}
    , every arrow/.append style={dash,thick}
    , row sep=tiny
    , column sep=tiny
    ]
    % 1 line
              &v_4 \ar[rr] \ar[dr] & &v_3 \ar[dl] & &
    \\
    % 2 line
    x \ar[dr, color=red] & &v_2 \ar[dl, color=red] \ar[dr, color=red]
                         & &v_{12} \ar[dr, color=red] &
    \\
    % 3 line
              &v_1 & &v_6 \ar[ur, color=red] \ar[dl] \ar[dr] & &y
    \\
    % 4 line
              & &v_{10} \ar[d] & &v_7 \ar[d] &
    \\
    % 5 line
              & &v_9 \ar[rr] & &v_8 &
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{corollary}[Distances \& morphisms of graphs]
  \label{cor: morphism-cycle}
  Consider graphs \(G\) and \(H\). If \(\phi: G \to H\) is a morphism of
  graphs then, for all \(x, y \in G\), we have
  \[
    d_H(\phi(x), \phi(y)) \leq d_G(x, y).
  \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Assume \(\phi\) is a morphism. Suppose \(x, y \in G\) are separated by a
  finite distance --- if not, the proposition follows trivially. Let \(P_k\) be
  a minimal path on \(G\) joining \(x\) and \(y\). Since \(\phi\) is a morphism,
  the image \(\phi(P_k) \subseteq H\) is a walk where \(\phi(x), \phi(y) \in
  P_k\) --- this follows directly from \cref{prop: morphism-path-walk}. Now,
  using \cref{lem: paths-on-walks} on \(\phi(P_k)\) and the vertices \(\phi(x)\)
  and \(\phi(y)\), it follows that there exists a path \(P \subseteq \phi(P_k)\)
  joining \(\phi(x)\) and \(\phi(y)\). Moreover, clearly \(\size P \leq
  \size{\phi(P_k)} \leq k\), thus \(d_H(\phi(x), \phi(y)) \leq d_G(x, y)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Path between sets]\label{def: A-B-path}
  Let \(A\) and \(B\) be disjoint sets of vertices. \(P = (v_0, \dots, v_n)\) is
  said to be an \(A\)-\(B\) path if \(v_0 \in A\) and \(v_n \in B\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Independent paths]\label{def: independent-paths}
  Two paths are said to be independent if their inner path share no vertex.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Cycles}

\begin{definition}\label{def: cycle}
  A cycle is a closed walk with size at least \(3\). A \(k\)-cycle is a cycle
  \(C^k\) whose length is \(k\).

  A \(k\)-cycle \emph{on} a graph \(G\) is the \emph{induced subgraph} of \(G\)
  given by \(G[\iota(C^k)]\) such that \(\iota: C^k \to G\) is an embedding of
  graphs.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chords]\label{def: chord}
  Let \(G\) be a graph and \(C\) be a cycle on \(G\). Given \(x, y \in C\), a
  chord is an edge \((x, y) \in E(G)\) such that \(E_C(x, y)\) is false.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Induced cycle]\label{def: induced-cycle}
  An induced cycle on a graph is a cycle with no chords.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Distance]\label{def: vertex-distance}
  Let \(G\) be a graph and \(x, y \in V(G)\) be any vertices. Let \(\mathcal P\)
  be the collection of all paths in \(G\) containing the vertices \(x\) and
  \(y\). If \(\mathcal P\) is nonempty, we define the distance of \(x\) and
  \(y\) on \(G\) to be the minimum length of the subpaths linking \(x\) to
  \(y\), in other words
  \[
    d_G(x, y) = \min_{P \in \mathcal P} \size{xPy}.
  \]
  On the other hand, if \(\mathcal P\) is empty, then \(d_G(x, y) = \infty\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Miscellaneous definitions]
  \label{def: miscellaneous-graph-cycle}
  We define the following:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a).]
    \setlength\itemsep{0.0em}
    \item\label{def: girth}
      (Girth) The girth of a graph \(G\) is the minimum length of a cycle on
      \(G\). In other words, let \(\mathcal C\) be the collection of all cycles
      on \(G\), the girth of \(G\) is
      \[
        g(G) = \min_{C \in \mathcal C} \size C.
      \]
    \item\label{def: circ-graph}
      (Circumference) The circumference of a graph \(G\) is the maximal length
      of a cycle on \(G\). In other words, let \(\mathcal C\) be the collection
      of all cycles on \(G\). If \(\mathcal C\) is nonempty, we set
      \[
        \Circ(G) = \max_{C \in \mathcal C} \size C.
      \]
    \item\label{def: diameter}
      (Diameter) The diameter of a graph \(G\) is the maximal distance between
      two vertices of \(G\), that is
      \[
        \diam(G) = \max_{x, y \in V(G)} d_G(x, y).
      \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: path-cycle-len-delta}
  Let \(G\) be a graph such that \(\delta(G) \geq 2\). Then there exists a path
  on \(G\) with length \(\delta(G)\) and a cycle on \(G\) with length at least
  \(\delta(G) + 1\).
\end{proposition}

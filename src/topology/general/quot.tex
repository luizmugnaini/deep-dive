\section{Quotient Space}

The motivation for the construction of the quotient topology is the study of
surjective set-functions \(\pi: X \epi S\) between topological spaces \(X\) and
sets \(S\), which induce an equivalence relation on the initial topological
space by means of arranging the points of \(X\) in classes where \(x \sim y\) for
\(x, y \in X\) if and only if \(\pi(x) = \pi(y)\), that is, \(x\) and \(y\) are common
points of a fiber \(\pi^{-1}(s)\) for some \(s \in S\).

The geometrically appealing version of such construction would be the idea of
gluing every element \(x \in \pi^{-1}(s)\) into a unique point --- this way we loose
some initial information about the topological space \(X\). However, we would
like to make this gluing process compatible with the theory of topology so far
constructed. To achieve that, one may make the point that we should make \(S\)
into a topological space for which its topology makes \(\pi\) a continuous
map. The first idea that may come to mind is that we can simply force the
continuity of \(\pi\) by defining a topology \(\mathcal T\) on \(S\) so that \(U \subseteq
S\) is an open set if and only if \(\pi^{-1}(U)\) is open --- which is exactly the
definition of a continuous map. Lets give this a formal definition.

\begin{definition}\label{def:quotient-topology}
Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(S\) be any set. Let also \(\pi: X \epi S\)
be a set-function. The quotient topology on \(S\) induced by the map \(\pi\) is
the finest topology such that \(\pi\) is a continuous map.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
The quotient topology is a topology.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(X /{\sim}\) be a topological space with the quotient topology induced by the
map \(\pi: X \epi X /{\sim}\). Consider an arbitrary collection \({\{U_{j}\}}_j\) of
open sets of \(X /{\sim}\). Notice that since \(\pi^{-1}(\bigcup_{j} U_{j}) = \bigcup_j
\pi^{-1}(U_j)\) then since \(\pi^{-1}(U_j)\) is open for all index \(j\), we
conclude that \(\bigcup_j \pi^{-1}(U_{j}) \subseteq X\) is open, hence the set \(\bigcup_j U_j \subseteq X
/{\sim}\) is necessarily open --- since \(\pi\) is continuous. Let now \(A, B \subseteq X
/{\sim}\) be any open sets, then \(\pi^{-1}(A \cap B) = \pi^{-1}(A) \cap \pi^{-1}(B) \subseteq X\),
which is open and therefore \(A \cap B\) is open in \(X /{\sim}\). We conclude that
the quotient topology indeed satisfies the properties of a topology.
\end{proof}

In other terms, let \(T_S\) be the collection of all topologies on \(S\) such
that \(\pi\) is a continuous map. The above definition simply says that the
quotient topology \(\mathcal T\) on the set \(S\) is the intersection \(\mathcal
T = \bigcap_{T \in T_S}T\). Even better than that definition is the fact that we can
determine the quotient topology by the following universal property.

\begin{theorem}[Universal property of the quotient topology]
\label{thm:universal-property-quotient-topology}
Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(S\) be any set, together with a
surjective set-function \(\pi: X \epi S\). The quotient topology \(\mathcal T\)
on \(S\) induced by \(\pi\) is such that, for all topological spaces \(Z\) and
every morphism \(g: X \to Z\) for which all \(x, y \in X\) such that \(\pi(x) =
\pi(y)\) then \(g(x) = g(y)\) --- i.e. \(g\) is constant on the fibers of \(\pi\)
---, there exists a unique morphism \(f: (S, \mathcal T) \to Z\) such that the
diagram
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \ar[r, "g"] \ar[d, two heads, swap, "\pi"] &Z\\
    S \ar[ur, swap, bend right, dashed, "f"]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes in \(\Top\). Moreover, if \(\mathcal T'\) is a topology on \(S\) such
that the diagram commutes, then necessarily \(\mathcal T' = \mathcal T\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since \(\pi\) is surjective, we can completely define a map \(f: S \to Z\) sending
\(s \mapsto g(x)\) such that \(x \in \pi^{-1}(s)\), which is well defined because, for
all \(x, y \in \pi^{-1}(s)\), we have \(g(x) = g(y)\), so that the image of each
\(s \in S\) under the map \(f\) is uniquely defined. We now show that \(f\) is,
in fact, continuous --- and hence a morphism. Let \(U \subseteq Z\) be any open set of
\(Z\), then, since \(g^{-1}(U)\) is open and \((f \pi)^{-1}(U) = \pi^{-1}
f^{-1}(U) = g^{-1}(U)\), \(f^{-1}(U)\) cannot be a closed set --- in fact, it
needs to be an open set, because \(\pi^{-1}(f^{-1}(U)) \subseteq X\) must be open, since
\(\pi\) is continuous. It follows that \(f\) is continuous and thus the said
morphism indeed exists.

For the uniqueness, let \(f\) and \(f'\) be two morphisms such that \(f\pi = g\)
and \(f'\pi = g\). Let \(s \in S\) be any point. Since \(\pi\) is surjective, there
exists \(x \in X\) for which \(x \in \pi^{-1}(s)\), therefore, \(f \pi(x) = f(s) =
f'\pi(x) = f'(s)\) for every element of their domain --- hence \(f = f'\).

Suppose now that both \((S, \mathcal T)\) and \((S, \mathcal T')\) satisfy the
universal property, that is, the following diagrams commutes for unique
morphisms \(f\) and \(h\)
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    &Z & \\
    (S, \mathcal T) \ar[ur, dashed, bend left, "f"]
    &X \ar[l, two heads, "\pi"] \ar[r, swap, two heads, "\pi"] \ar[u, "g"]
    &(S, \mathcal T') \ar[ul, dashed, bend right, swap, "f'"]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
Since the diagram commutes for all \(Z\), let \(Z = (S, \mathcal T)\), and
consider the map \(f' = \Id': (S, \mathcal T') \to (S, \mathcal
T)\). Then, given any \(U \in \mathcal T\) we find that since \(\Id'\) is
continuous that \(\Id'^{-1}(U) = U \subseteq (S, \mathcal T')\) is open, hence
\(\mathcal T \subseteq \mathcal T'\). Analogously, let \(Z = (S, \mathcal T')\) and
consider \(f = \Id: (S, \mathcal T) \to (S, \mathcal T')\). Let \(U' \in \mathcal
T'\) then from the continuity of \(\Id\) we find that \(\Id^{-1}(U') = U' \subseteq
(S, \mathcal T)\) is open, therefore \(\mathcal T' \subseteq \mathcal T\). Thus indeed
\(\mathcal T = \mathcal T'\) as wanted.
\end{proof}

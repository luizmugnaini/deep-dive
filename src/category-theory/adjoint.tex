\section{Reflections}

\begin{definition}[Reflection along a functor]
\label{def:reflection-functor}
Let \(F: \cat C \to \cat D\) be any functor and \(D \in \cat D\). We define a
\emph{reflection of \(D\) along \(F\)} to be a pair \((R_D, \eta_D)\) where
\(R_D \in \cat C\) is an object, and \(\eta_D: D \to F R_D\) is a morphism of
\(\cat D\) such that: if \(C \in \cat C\) is any object and
\(\delta: D \to F C\) is a morphism of \(\cat D\), then there exists a
\emph{unique morphism} \(\varepsilon: R_D \to C\) in \(\cat C\) such that the
diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
D \ar[rd, "\eta_D"'] \ar[rr, "\delta"] & &F C \\
&F R_D \ar[ru, dashed, "F \varepsilon"'] &
\end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes in the category \(\cat D\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Uniqueness of reflections]
\label{prop:reflection-unique-up-to-iso}
Let \(F: \cat C \to \cat D\) be a functor and \(D \in \cat D\) be an object. If
the reflection of \(D\) along \(F\) exists, then it is \emph{unique up to
  isomorphism}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Suppose the reflection of \(D\) along \(F\) exists and let \((R, \eta)\) and
\((R', \eta')\) be two reflections of \(D\). Considering morphisms \(\delta: D
\to F R\)

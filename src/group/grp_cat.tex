\section{\texorpdfstring{\(\Grp\)}{Grp} Category}

\begin{definition}[Group morphism]\label{def: grp-morphism}
  Let \((G, \circledast)\) and \((H, \circledcirc)\) be groups together with
  their binary operation. A group morphism --- also called homomorphism --- is a
  map \(\varphi: (G, \circledast) \to (H, \circledcirc)\) such that the that the
  following diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      G \times G \ar[d, swap, "\circledast"] \ar[r, "\varphi \times \varphi"]
      &H \times H \ar[d, "\circledcirc"] \\
      G \ar[r, "\varphi"] &H
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Where \(\varphi \times \varphi\) is uniquely defined in \(\Set\) by
  \cref{prop: product-morphism} --- mapping \((g, \ell) \xmapsto{\varphi \times
  \varphi} (\varphi(g), \varphi(\ell))\). The commutativity of such diagram can
  be viewed as the requirement that \(\varphi\) preserves the structure coming
  from the binary operations --- that is, for any \(g, \ell \in G\)
  \[
    \varphi(g \circledast \ell) = \varphi(g) \circledcirc \varphi(\ell).
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Category of groups]\label{def: grp}
  The category of groups \(\Grp\) consists of the collection of objects ---
  called groups --- and group morphisms between them.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  \(\Grp\) is a category.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \((G, \circledast)\), \((H, \circledcirc)\) and \((K, \star)\) be any
  groups. The identity \(\Id_G: G \to G\) is a group morphism since \(\Id_G(g
  \circledast \ell) = g \circledast \ell\) for any \(g, \ell \in G\). Moreover,
  we can define a map
  \[
    f: \Hom_{\Grp}(G, H) \times \Hom_{\Grp}(H, K) \to \Hom_{\Grp}(G, K)
  \]
  with the mapping \((\psi, \varphi) \xmapsto f \psi \varphi\) --- since
  the following diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      G \times G \ar[r, "\varphi \times \varphi"]
      \ar[d, swap, "\circledast"]
      \ar[rr, bend left, "(\psi \varphi) \times (\psi \varphi)"]
      &H \times H \ar[r, "\psi \times \psi"]
      \ar[d, "\circledcirc"]
      &K \times K \ar[d, "\star"]
      \\
      G \ar[r, "\varphi"]
      \ar[rr, bend right, swap, "\psi \varphi"]
      &H \ar[r, "\psi"] &K
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  In other words, for any \(g, \ell \in G\) we have
  \[
    \psi \varphi (g \circledast \ell)
    = \psi(\varphi(g \circledast \ell))
    = \psi(\varphi(g) \circledcirc \varphi(\ell))
    = \psi(\varphi(g)) \star \psi(\varphi(\ell))
    = \psi \varphi(g) \star \psi \varphi(\ell).
  \]
  Therefore \(\psi \varphi \in \Hom_\Grp(G, K)\). For the other part of the
  diagram, we have
  \[
    (\psi \varphi) \times (\psi \varphi) (g, \ell)
    = (\psi \varphi(g), \psi \varphi(\ell))
    = \psi \times \psi(\varphi(g), \varphi(\ell))
    =(\psi \times \psi) (\varphi \times \varphi) (g, \ell)
  \]

  Since group morphisms are maps in \(\Set\), we have that associativity is
  inherited.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: forgetful-func-grp-set}
  There exists a covariant forgetful functor \(F: \Grp \to \Set\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  For objects, define \(F\) as \(F(G, \circledast) = G\) --- where we denoted
  \(G\) together with its binary operation only to express that the
  multiplicative structure is lost in the process. Let \(\varphi: (G,
  \circledast) \to (H, \circledcirc)\) be a group morphism, denote by
  \(\overline \varphi \in \Mor(\Set)\) the function \(\overline\varphi: G \to
  H\) such that \(\overline\varphi(g) = \varphi(g)\) for all \(g \in G\). For
  such morphisms we define \(F\) as \(F\varphi = \overline\varphi: F(G,
  \circledast) \to F(H, \circledcirc)\).

  Let \(\psi \in \Hom_\Grp((H, \circledcirc), (K, \star))\), then we have
  \(\overline{\psi \varphi} = \overline \psi \overline \varphi: H \to K\). Thus
  \[
    F(\psi \varphi) = \overline{\psi \varphi}
    = \overline \psi \overline \varphi = F\psi F\varphi.
  \]
  This shows that \(F\) is a covariant forgetful functor.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  The trivial group \(* \in \Grp\) is the initial and final object of \(\Grp\).
  That is, for any \(G \in \Grp\) the diagram
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      * \ar[r, dashed, bend right, swap, "\varphi"]
      &G \ar[l, dashed, bend right, swap, "\psi"]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  commutes for uniquely defined group morphisms \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(G \in \Grp\) be any group. We define maps \(\varphi: * \to G\) mapping
  \(e \xmapsto\varphi e_G\), where \(e\) is the only element of \(*\) --- being
  unique possible map \(* \to G\) that preserves the group structure. Clearly,
  \(\varphi\) is a group morphism since \(\varphi(e e) = \varphi(e) = e_G =
  \varphi(e) \varphi(e)\) --- this shows that \(*\) is the initial object of
  \(\Grp\). Let \(\psi: G \to *\) be a map defined by \(g \xmapsto\psi e\) ---
  which is clearly unique. Then \(\psi\) is a morphism of groups, because
  \(\psi(g h) = e = \psi(g) \psi(h)\) --- showing that \(*\) is the final object
  of \(\Grp\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Group morphism properties]
  Let \((G, \circledast), (H, \circledcirc)\) be groups and consider \(\varphi \in
  \Hom_\Grp(G, H)\). Define \(\operatorname{inv}_G: G \isoto G\) and
  \(\operatorname{inv}_H: H \isoto H\) as the maps \(g \xmapsto
  {\operatorname{inv}_G} g^{-1}\) and \(h \xmapsto {\operatorname{inv}_H}
  h^{-1}\). Then the following diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      G \ar[r, "\varphi"]
      \ar[d, swap, "\operatorname{inv}_G"]
      &H \ar[d, "\operatorname{inv}_H"] \\
      G \ar[r, "\varphi"] &H
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(g \in G\) be any element, then
  \[
    \varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g^{-1} e_G) = \varphi(g^{-1} \circledast g
    \circledast g^{-1}) = \varphi(g^{-1}) \circledcirc \varphi(g) \circledcirc
    \varphi(g^{-1}),
  \]
  applying cancellation law on the equation above we find
  \[
    e_H = \varphi(g) \circledcirc \varphi(g^{-1}).
  \]
  Hence \(\varphi(g^{-1}) = {\varphi(g)}^{-1}\). Moreover, this implies that \(e_G
  \xmapsto \varphi e_H\) since
  \[
    \varphi(e_G) = \varphi(g \circledast g^{-1}) = \varphi(g) \circledcirc
    \varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g) \circledcirc {\varphi(g)}^{-1} = e_H.
  \]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Group action]\label{def: grp-action}
  Let \(\cat C\) be a category and \(A \in \cat C\) be an object. A group action
  of \(G \in \Grp\) on \(A\) is a morphism of groups \(G \to \Aut_{\cat{C}}
  (A)\).
\end{definition}

The following proposition is a trivial one, but it is a really useful tool to
prove the non-existence of non-trivial morphisms between certain groups --- it
relies on arguments based on the order of elements of each group.

\begin{proposition}[Morphisms and orders]\label{prop: grp-morph-order}
  Let \(G \in \Grp\) be a group admitting an element \(g \in G\) of finite order
  \(|g| \in \N\). Let \(H\) be any group and consider the morphism \(\phi: G \to
  H\). We have that \(|\phi(g)|\) divides the order of \(|g|\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Notice that \({\phi(g)}^{|g|} = \phi(g^{|g|}) = \phi(e_G) = e_H\), hence \(|g|\)
  is a multiple of the order of \(\phi(g) \in H\).
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  Consider for example the collection of morphisms \(\Hom_\Grp(C_7, C_{15})\).
  Let \(\phi\) be any such morphism. Consider any element \(g \in C_7\) and
  recall that \(|g|\) must be a divisor of \(7\) --- see \cref{prop:
  ord-cyclic-elem}. On the other hand, if \(h \in C_{15}\) then \(|h|\) divides
  \(15\). From \cref{prop: grp-morph-order} we see that if \(\phi(g) = h\), then
  \(|h|\) must divide \(|g|\), but \(\gcd(7, 15) = 1\), hence
  \(|h| = 1\) --- that is \(h = e_H\) and \(\phi\) is the trivial morphism
  \(\phi(g) = e_H\) for all \(g \in C_7\). This shows that there is no
  non-trivial morphism between \(C_7\) and \(C_{15}\).
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Kernel]
  We define the kernel of a morphism of groups \(\phi \in \Hom_\Grp(G, H)\) as
  the collection \(\{g \in G: \phi(g) = e_H\}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Injectivity of morphisms]\label{prop: ker-trivial-inj}
  A morphism of groups is injective if and only if its kernel is trivial.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(\phi: G \to H\) be any morphism. If \(\phi\) is injective then clearly
  \(\ker\phi = \{e_G\}\). On the other hand, if \(\ker\phi = \{e_G\}\), then,
  given elements \(g, g' \in G\) such that \(\phi(g) = \phi(g')\), then,
  multiplying both sides by \(\phi{(g')}^{-1}\) we get
  \[
    \phi(g) {\phi(g')}^{-1} = \phi(g) \phi(g'^{-1}) = \phi(gg'^{-1}) = e_G.
  \]
  That is, \(gg'^{-1} \in \ker\phi\), but since \(\ker\phi\) is trivial, then
  \(gg'^{-1} = e_G\) and hence \(g = g'\) --- in other words, \(\phi\) is
  injective.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Isomorphism of Groups}

\begin{proposition}[Isomorphisms are bijections]\label{prop: grp-iso-bij}
  Let \(\phi \in \Mor(\Grp)\). Then \(\phi\) is an isomorphism if and only if it
  is a bijection.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Consider an isomorphism \(\phi: G \to H\). Using the forgetful functor \(F:
  \Grp \to \Set\) we see that \(F\phi\) is a bijection of sets in \(\Set\) ---
  recall \cref{lem: functor preserve iso} ---, thus \(\phi\) defines a bijection
  between the elements of \(G\) and \(H\).

  On the other hand, if \(\phi\) is a bijection, consider its set-function
  inverse \({(F\phi)}^{-1}: H \to G\). We now show that \({(F\phi)}^{-1}\) preserves
  the structures of groups. Since \(\phi(e_G) = e_H\), then \({(F\phi)}^{-1}(e_H)
  = e_G\). Moreover, for any \(h, h' \in H\) --- since \(\phi\) is surjective
  ---, take elements \(g, g' \in G\) such that \(\phi(g) = h\) and \(\phi(g') =
  h'\), then we find that \({(F\phi)}^{-1}(hh') = g g' = {(F\phi)}^{-1}(h) \cdot
  {(F\phi)}^{-1}(h')\). This implies in the existence of a naturally induced
  morphism of groups \(\phi^{-1}: H \to G\) defined by \(\phi^{-1}(h) =
  {(F\phi)}^{-1}(h)\). It is clear that \(\phi^{-1}\) is the right and left
  inverse of \(\phi\), thus \(\phi^{-1}\) is the inverse of \(\phi\) in \(\Grp\)
  and \(\phi\) is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: iso-order-com}
  Let \(\phi: G \isoto H\) be an isomorphism of groups. Then:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item For all \(g \in G\), we have \(|g| = |\phi(g)|\).
    \item \(G\) is commutative if and only if \(H\) is commutative.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(g \in G\) be any element, then from \cref{prop: grp-morph-order} we have
  that \(|\phi(g)|\) divides \(|g|\). Since \(\phi^{-1}\) exists and is a
  morphism of groups, it also follows that \(|g|\) divides \(|\phi(g)|\) ---
  hence \(|g| = |\phi(g)|\).

  Let \(G\) be a commutative group and \(G \iso H\). Let \(h, h' \in H\) be any
  elements and consider \(\phi^{-1}(h) = g\) and \(\phi^{-1}(h') = g'\). From
  the structure preserving property of \(\phi\) we have
  \[
    h h' = \phi(g) \phi(g') = \phi(gg') = \phi(g'g) = \phi(g')\phi(g) = h' h.
  \]
  That is, \(H\) is commutative. The counter-implication is equivalent and will
  be omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Inner automorphism]\label{lem: grp-inner-aut}
  Let \(G \in \Grp\). For each \(g \in G\), the map \(\gamma_g: G \to G\) given
  by \(\gamma_g(a) = gag^{-1}\) is an automorphism --- called inner
  automorphism of \(G\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(g \in G\) be any element. Suppose \(a \in \ker\gamma_g\), then
  \(\gamma_g(a) = gag^{-1} = e_G\), hence, \(a = g^{-1} e_G g = g^{-1}g = e_G\),
  that is \(\ker\gamma_g = e_G\) --- \(\gamma_g\) is injective. Let \(g' \in G\)
  be any element, then, \(\gamma_g(g^{-1} g' g) = g (g^{-1} g' g) g^{-1} = g'\),
  that is, \(\gamma_g\) is surjective. We conclude that \(\gamma_g\) is a
  bijection --- hence an isomorphism, so \(\gamma_g \in \Aut_\Grp(G)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Inner automorphism correspondence]\label{lem: grp-inner-aut-cor}
  Let \(G \in \Grp\). The map \(\phi: G \to \Aut_\Grp(G)\) defined by the
  mapping \(\phi(g) = \gamma_g\) (where \(\gamma_g\) is defined in \cref{lem:
  grp-inner-aut}) is a morphism of groups.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(g, g' \in G\) be any elements, then
  \[
    \gamma_{gg'}(a) = (gg')a{(gg')}^{-1} = (g g') a (g'^{-1} g^{-1})
    = g(g' a g'^{-1}) g^{-1} = \gamma_g \gamma_{g'}(a).
  \]
  This being said, its easy to see that \(\phi\) preserves the group structure:
  \(\phi(gg') = \gamma_{gg'} = \gamma_g \gamma_{g'} = \phi(g) \phi(g')\). Thus
  \(\phi\) is a morphism of groups.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{More Thoughts On Cyclic Groups}

We can now state the definition of a cyclic group in a formal manner, it goes as
follows:

\begin{definition}[Cyclic group]\label{def: cyclic-grp}
  A group \(G\) is said to be cyclic if \(G \iso \Z\) or \(G \iso \Z/n\Z\) for
  some \(n \in \N\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  A finite group of order \(n \in \N\) is cyclic if and only if it contains an
  element of order \(n\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(G\) be a cyclic group of order \(n\). Since \(G\) is finite, then there
  exists an isomorphism \(\phi: G \isoto \Z/n\Z\). Consider the element \(g =
  \phi^{-1}({[1]}_n) \in G\), from \cref{prop: iso-order-com} we see that \(|g| =
  n\).

  Let \(G\) be a finite group of order \(n\) and \(x \in G\) be such that \(|x|
  = n\). Let \(\phi: G \to \Z/n\Z\) be any morphism of groups sending \(x
  \mapsto {[1]}_n\). Consider the collection \(G' = \{e_G, x, x^2, \dots,
  x^{n-1}\} \subseteq G\), and notice that, together with the binary operation
  of \(G\), \(G'\) becomes a group of \(n\) elements --- that is, \(G' = G\) and
  every element \(g \in G\) can be written as \(g = x^k\) for some \(1 \leq k
  \leq n\). This implies in \(\phi\) injective --- thus a bijection. From
  \cref{prop: grp-iso-bij} we see that \(\phi\) is an isomorphism \(G \iso
  \Z/n\Z\) --- \(G\) is a cyclic group, which finishes our proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:order-cyclic-totient}
  The order of the cyclic group \(C_n\) is equal to \(\phi(n)\), where \(\phi\) is the
  Euler totient function --- that is, the number of positive integers less than
  \(n\) that are relatively prime to \(n\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(x \in C_n\) be a generator of the group --- that is, \(x^n = e\) --- then
  for all \(d < n\) such that \(\gcd(d, n) = 1\) we have \(x^d \neq x\) and
  \((x^d)^n = e\) thus \(x^d\) is a generator of \(C_n\). Therefore the number
  of distict elements of \(C_n\) is the same as the number of positive integers
  coprimes of \(n\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Group Products}

Let \((G, \circledast), (H, \circledcirc) \in \Grp\) be any objects. We define a
binary operation \(\cdot: (G \times H)^2 \to G \times H\) as the mapping
\begin{equation}\label{eq: grp-prod-bin}
  (g, h) \cdot (g', h') = (g \circledast g', h \circledcirc h').
\end{equation}
Such binary operation defines a group structure on \(G \times H\). Notice that,
given an element \((g, h) \in G \times H\), there exists an element \((g^{-1},
h^{-1}) \in G \times H\) such that \((g, h) \cdot (g^{-1}, h^{-1}) = (e_G,
e_H)\). Moreover, clearly \((e_G, e_H) \in G \times H\) is the identity element
of the structure. Hence \((G \times H, \cdot) \in \Grp\).

Also, the natural projections \(\pi_G: G \times H \to G\) and \(\pi_H: G \times
H \to H\) define morphisms of groups.

\begin{definition}[Direct product]
  The group \(G \times H\) is called direct product group of \(G\) and \(H\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  The direct products of groups are products on the category of groups,
  \(\Grp\). That is, for all group \(W\) and group morphisms \(f \in
  \Hom_\Grp(W, G)\) and \(g \in \Hom_\Grp(W, H)\), there exists a unique
  morphism \(\varphi \in \Hom_\Grp(W, G \times H)\) such that the following
  diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      &W
      \ar[d, dashed, "\varphi"]
      \ar[ddr, bend left, "g"]
      \ar[ddl, swap, bend right, "f"]
      & \\
      &G \times H \ar[dr, swap, "\pi_H"] \ar[dl, "\pi_G"] & \\
      G & &H
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We just take \(\varphi: W \to G \times H\) as the mapping \(w \xmapsto \varphi
  (f(w), g(w))\). We show that \(\varphi\) exists in \(\Grp\): let \(x, y \in
  W\) be any elements, then, since \(f\) and \(g\) are group morphisms, we find
  that
  \[
    \varphi(xy) = (f(xy), g(xy)) = (f(x) f(y), g(x) g(y))
    = (f(x), g(x)) (f(y), g(y)) = \varphi(x) \varphi(y).
  \]
  That is, \(\varphi\) is a group morphism. The uniqueness comes from the
  covariant functor \(F: \Grp \to \Set\), since \(\Set\) allows for products and
  hence the set-function \(F \varphi\) is unique.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  We now show that if \(G, H \in \Grp\) are such that \(G \iso H \times G\),
  \emph{it does not follow that} \(H\) is trivial.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\(\Ab\)}{Ab} --- Category of Abelian Groups}

\begin{definition}[Category of abelian groups]
  We define the category of abelian groups, denoted \(\Ab\), to be the category
  whose objects are abelian groups and group morphisms between them.
\end{definition}

In the following propositions we are going to describe ways of telling if the
group you might be interested is abelian or not.

\begin{proposition}
  A group \(G\) is abelian if and only either one of the following conditions
  are satisfied:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item The map \(G \to G\) mapping \(g \mapsto g^{-1}\) is a morphism of
      groups.
    \item The map \(G \to G\) mapping \(g \mapsto g^2\) is a morphism of groups.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Denote the first map by \(\phi\) and the second by \(\psi\). If \(G\) is
  abelian, then for any \(g, g' \in G\) we have:
  \begin{gather*}
    \phi(gg') = (gg')^{-1} = g'^{-1} g^{-1} = g^{-1}g'^{-1} = \phi(g) \phi(g'),
    \\
    \psi(gg') = (gg')^2 = (gg')(gg') = g^2g'^2 = \psi(g)\psi(g').
  \end{gather*}
  That is, \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are morphisms. Now suppose \(\phi\) and
  \(\psi\) are morphisms and consider any elements \(g, g' \in G\) --- we get
  the following relations from each of the morphisms:
  \begin{gather*}
    gg' = \phi(g^{-1})\phi(g'^{-1}) = \phi(g^{-1}g'^{-1})
    = \phi((g'g)^{-1}) = g'g,
    \\
    (gg')^2 = \phi(gg') = \phi(g) \phi(g') = g^2 g'^2.
  \end{gather*}
  Using cancellation law for the second relation we find \(g'g = gg'\). This
  shows that \(G\) is abelian.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(\phi \in \Hom_\Grp(G, \Aut_\Grp(G))\) be the morphism of groups mapping
  \(g \xmapsto \phi \gamma_g\) --- as defined in \cref{lem: grp-inner-aut-cor}.
  \(G\) is an abelian group if and only if \(\phi\) is trivial.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(G\) be an abelian group, then for all \(g \in G\) the corresponding inner
  automorphism \(\gamma_g\) maps \(a \xmapsto{\gamma_g} g a g^{-1} = a (g g^{-1}) = a\)
  hence \(\gamma_g = \Id_G\), thus \(\phi\) is indeed trivial. Let \(\phi\) be trivial,
  then for all \(g \in G\) the map \(\gamma_g = \Id_G\) and therefore for all \(a \in G\)
  we have \(g a g^{-1} = a\), which implies in \(g a g^{-1} = a g g^{-1} = a
  g^{-1} g = g g^{-1} a = g^{-1} g a\) --- that is, the group \(G\) is abelian.
\end{proof}

Now that we know some ways of identifying abelian groups, we dive deep again
into the categorical foundations of the category of abelian groups \(\Ab\).

\begin{proposition}[\(\Hom_\Ab\) abelian group]\label{prop: hom-ab-grp}
  Let \(G, H \in \Ab\) be any two commutative groups. The collection of
  morphisms \(\Hom_\Ab(G, H)\) forms an abelian group with a binary operation
  defined by \((\phi + \psi)(g) = \phi(g) +_H \psi(g)\) --- where \(+_H\) is the
  binary operation of \(H\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(\phi, \psi \in \Hom_\Ab(G, H)\) be any morphisms and consider elements
  \(g, g' \in G\). From the commutativity of \(H\) it follows that
  \begin{align*}
    (\phi + \psi)(g +_G g')
    &= \phi(g +_G g') +_H \psi(g +_G g')
    \\
    &= \left(\phi(g) +_H \phi(g')\right) +_H \left(\psi(g) +_H \psi(g')\right)
    \\
    &= \left(\phi(g) +_H \psi(g)\right) +_H \left(\phi(g') +_H \psi(g')\right)
    \\
    &= (\phi + \psi)(g) +_H (\phi + \psi)(g').
  \end{align*}
  That is, \(\phi + \psi \in \Hom_\Ab(G, H)\). Moreover, given a morphism \(f
  \in \Hom_\Ab(G, H)\), define the map \(k: G \to H\) mapping \(k(g) =
  f(g)^{-1}\). Notice that \(k\) is a morphism:
  \begin{align*}
    k(g +_G g')
    &= f(g +_G g')^{-1} \\
    &= (f(g) +_H f(g'))^{-1} \\
    &= f(g')^{-1} +_H f(g)^{-1} \\
    &= f(g)^{-1} +_H f(g')^{-1} \\
    &= k(g) +_H k(g').
  \end{align*}
  Moreover, \((f + k)(g) = f(g) +_H k(g) = f(g) +_H f(g)^{-1} = e_H\) --- that
  is, \(f + k\) is the trivial morphism \(g \mapsto e_H\), i.e. \(k\) is the
  inverse of \(f\). This finishes the proof that \(\Hom_\Ab(G, H)\) is a group.
  For the commutativity, it follows directly from the commutativity of \(H\):
  for all \(\phi, \psi \in \Hom_\Ab(G, H)\) we have
  \[
    (\phi + \psi)(g) = \phi(g) +_H \psi(g) = \psi(g) +_H \phi(g) = (\psi +
    \phi)(g).
  \]
\end{proof}

The following corollaries follow immediately from the construction of the
category.

\begin{corollary}
  Let \(G \in \Grp\) and \(H \in \Ab\). The collection of morphisms
  \(\Hom_\Grp(G, H)\) forms a group under the binary operation defined above.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
  Let \(A \in \Set\) and \(H \in \Ab\). The collection of morphisms
  \(\Hom_\Set(A, FH)\) forms a group under the binary operation defined above
  --- where \(F: \Grp \to \Set\) is a forgetful functor.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Coproduct and Fiber Product}

\begin{proposition}[Coproduct in \(\Ab\)]\label{prop: coprod-ab}
  The direct product of abelian groups is a coproduct in \(\Ab\). That is, for
  any \(G, H, W \in \Ab\) and morphisms \(f \in \Hom_\Ab(W, G)\) and \(k \in
  \Hom_\Ab(W, H)\), there exists a unique morphism \(\varphi \in \Hom_\Ab(W, G
  \times H)\) such that the following diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      G \ar[dr, "\iota_G"] \ar[ddr, bend right, swap, "f"] &
      &H \ar[dl, swap, "\iota_H"] \ar[ddl, bend left, "k"] \\
      &G \times H \ar[d, dashed, "\varphi"]  & \\
      &W &
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Where we define inclusion morphisms \(g \xmapsto{\iota_G} (g, e_H)\) and \(h
  \xmapsto{\iota_H} (e_G, h)\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Since \(\Ab \subset \Grp\) --- that is, the category of abelian groups is a
  subcategory of \(\Grp\) --- then, from \cref{prop: forgetful-func-grp-set}
  there exists a functor \(\Ab \to \Set\). Since coproducts exists in \(\Set\)
  and are unique, a set-function \(\varphi\) exists and is unique, commuting the
  diagram in \(\Set\). We now show that we can extend such set-function into a
  morphism of groups. Let \(\varphi: G \times H \to W\) be the mapping \((g, h)
  \xmapsto \varphi f(g) k(h)\). Notice that
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi((g, h)(g', h'))
    = \varphi(gg', hh')
    = f(g g') k(hh')
    = f(g) f(g') k(h) k(h')
    &= f(g) k(h) f(g') k(h') \\
    &= \varphi(g, h) \varphi(g', h')
  \end{align*}
  that is, \(\varphi\) is a morphism of groups.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Coproducts in \(\Grp\)]
  \cref{prop: coprod-ab} is not at all true for the category of
  groups. Consider for instance the cyclic groups \(C_2 = \{e_x, x\}\) and \(C_3
  = \{e_y, y, y^2\}\). Let \(\sigma_k \in S_3\), for \(0 \leq k \leq 2\) be the
  rotation of \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) by \(k\), that is, the permutations represented by
  \[
    M_{\sigma_0} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\ 0 &0 &1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \qquad
    M_{\sigma_1} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0 &0 &1 \\ 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \qquad
    M_{\sigma_2} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0 &1 &0 \\ 0 &0 &1 \\ 1 &0 &0
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  Consider the embeddings \(f: C_2 \mono S_3\) mapping \(x^k \xmapsto f
  \sigma_k\) for \(k \in \{0, 1\}\), and \(g: C_3 \mono S_3\) mapping \(y^k
  \xmapsto g \sigma_k\) for \(k \in \{0, 1, 2\}\).

  Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \(C_2 \times C_3\) is a coproduct
  in \(\Grp\), that is, exists a unique morphism \(\varphi: C_2 \times C_3 \to
  S_3\) such that \(f = \varphi \iota_{C_2}\) and \(g = \varphi \iota_{C_3}\).
  Since \(\varphi\) is supposedly a morphism of groups,
  \begin{gather*}
    \varphi(x, y) = \varphi(x, e_y) \varphi(e_x, y) = \sigma_1 \sigma_1 =
    \sigma_2 \\
    \varphi(x, y^2) = \varphi(x, e_y) \varphi(e_x, y^2) = \sigma_1 \sigma_2
    = \sigma_0
  \end{gather*}
  However, \(\varphi(e_x, e_y) = \sigma_0\) and on the other hand we have
  \(\varphi(x, y) \varphi(x, y^2) = \sigma_2\), which contradicts the properties
  of a group morphism. This shows that there exists no such \(\varphi\) in
  \(\Grp\) and hence \(C_2 \times C_3\) is not a coproduct in \(\Grp\).

  Although \(C_2 \times C_3\) is not a coproduct in \(\Grp\), that doesn't mean
  that \(\Grp\) has no coproducts, they just behave differently when compared
  with \(\Ab\). For instance, let \(C_2 * C_3 \in \Grp\) be defined to be the
  group generated by elements \(x\) and \(y\), such that \(x^2 = e\) and \(y^3 =
  e\). We'll now show that \(C_2 * C_3\) is a coproduct of \(C_2\) and \(C_3\)
  in \(\Grp\). Let \(G\) be any group and consider morphisms \(f: C_2 \to G\)
  and \(k: C_3 \to G\). The inclusions \(\iota_{C_2}: C_2 \to C_2 * C_3\) and
  \(\iota_{C_3}: C_3 \to C_2 * C_3\) will be naturally given maps by taking each
  element to itself.

  Let \(q \in C_2 * C_3\) be any element. We know that there exists a finite
  collection of coefficients \(I = \{(a, b) \in \Z^2\}\) such that \(q =
  \prod_{(a, b) \in I} x^a y^b\). Define \(\phi: C_2 * C_3 \to G\) as the
  mapping
  \[
    \phi(q) = \phi\left(\prod_{(a, b) \in I} x^a y^b\right)
    = \prod_{(a, b) \in I} f(x^a) k(y^b)
    = \prod_{(a, b) \in I} f(x)^a k(y)^b
  \]
  It should be clear that this definition implies \(\phi \iota_{C_2} = f\) and
  \(\phi \iota_{C_3} = g\). Notice that \(\phi(e) = f(e) k(e) = e_G\) and for
  all \(q, p \in C_2 * C_3\) --- with respective coefficients \(I = \{(a, b) \in
  \Z^2\}\) and \(J = \{(c,d) \in \Z^2\}\) --- we have
  \begin{align*}
    \phi(q) \phi(p)
    = \phi\left[ \prod_{(a, b) \in I} x^a y^b \right]
    \phi\left[ \prod_{(c, d) \in J} x^c y^d \right]
    &= \prod_{(a, b) \in I} f(x^a) k(y^b)
    \prod_{(c, d) \in J} f(x^c) k(y^d)
    \\
    &= \prod_{(\alpha, \beta) \in A} f(x^\alpha) g(y^\beta)
    \\
    &= \phi\left(\prod_{(\alpha, \beta) \in A} f(x^\alpha) g(y^\beta) \right)
    \\
    &= \phi\left(\prod_{(a, b) \in I} x^a y^b
      \prod_{(c, d) \in J} x^c y^d\right)
    = \phi(qp)
  \end{align*}
  that is, \(\phi\) is a morphism of groups --- where we define \(A\) as the
  concatenation of the coefficients \(I\) and \(J\). We have shown that the
  following diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      C_2 \ar[dr, "\iota_{C_2}"] \ar[ddr, swap, bend right, "f"]
      & &C_3 \ar[dl, swap, "\iota_{C_3}"] \ar[ddl, bend left, "g"] \\
      &C_2 * C_3 \ar[d, dashed, "\phi"] & \\
      &G &
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  We can then conclude that \(C_2 * C_3\), as defined above, is the coproduct of
  \(C_2\) and \(C_3\) in \(\Grp\).
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}[Fiber products]
  Fiber products exist in \(\Ab\). That is, given abelian groups \(G, H, W \in
  \Ab\) and group morphisms \(\phi \in \Hom_\Ab(G, W)\) and \(\psi \in
  \Hom_\Ab(H, W)\). Let
  \[
    G \times_W H \in \Ab_W
  \]
  be the fiber product of \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) in the category \(\Ab_W
  \subseteq \Ab\)\footnote{As a reminder: \(\Ab_W\) is the category whose
  objects are morphisms \(f \in \Hom_\Ab(-, W)\). If \(f: G \to W\) and \(g: H
  \to W\) are objects of \(\Ab_W\), a morphism \(h \in \Hom_{\Ab_W}(f, g)\) is
  such that \(hg = f\).} for which exists natural projections \(\pi_G\) and
  \(\pi_H\). Let \(Q \in \Ab\) be any abelian group and consider any morphisms \(f \in
  \Hom_\Ab(Q, G)\) and \(k \in \Hom_\Ab(Q, H)\). Then there exists a unique
  morphism \(\varphi \in \Hom_\Ab(Q, P)\) such that the following diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      Q \ar[dr, dashed, "\varphi"] \ar[ddr, bend right, swap, "f"]
      \ar[drr, bend left, "k"]
      & & \\
      &G \times_W H \ar[r, "\pi_H"] \ar[d, swap, "\pi_G"] &H \ar[d, "\psi"] \\
      &G \ar[r, swap, "\phi"] &W
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Define \(G \times_W H = \{(g, h) \in G \times H : \phi(g) = \psi(h)\}\). Since
  \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are group morphisms, given \((g, h) \in G \times_W H\),
  we have
  \[
    \phi(g^{-1}) = \phi(g)^{-1} = \psi(h)^{-1} = \psi(h^{-1}),
  \]
  that is, \((g^{-1}, h^{-1}) \in G \times_W H\) exists and is the inverse of
  \((g, h)\). Moreover, given any elements \((g, h), (g', h') \in G \times_W H\), the
  product \((g, h)(g', h') = (gg', hh')\) is such that
  \[
    \phi(gg') = \phi(g) \phi(g') = \psi(h) \psi(h') = \psi(hh'),
  \]
  thus \((gg', hh') \in G \times_W H\). This shows that \(G \times_W H\) is
  indeed a group and since \(G \times H\) is abelian, so is the fiber product
  defined above.

  From the forgetful functor \(\Ab \to \Set\) we know that there exists a unique
  set-function \(\varphi\) such that the diagram commutes in \(\Set\). If we
  define \(\varphi\) as the mapping \(q \overset \varphi \longmapsto (f(q),
  k(q))\) we can see that it preserves the group structure, since
  \[
    \varphi(qq') = (f(qq'), k(qq')) = (f(q)f(q'), k(q)k(q'))
    = (f(q), k(q))(f(q'), k(q')) = \varphi(q) \varphi(q'),
  \]
  that is, \(\varphi \in \Mor(\Ab)\).

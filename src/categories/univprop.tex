\section{Universal Properties}

\subsection{Quotients}

Denote \(\sim\) an equivalence relation between elements of a given object
\(A\) in the category \(\Set\). We say that the quotient \(A/{\sim}\) is
universal with respect to the property that the image of equivalent elements
under morphism is equal.

Moreover, the objects of the category we'll be dealing will be objects
\(\varphi \in \Hom(A, Z)\) and the morphisms between objects \(\varphi : A \to
Z\) and \(\varphi' : A \to Z'\) is defined to be the commutative diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  &A \ar[dl, swap, "\varphi"] \ar[dr, "\varphi'"] & \\
Z \ar[rr, "\psi"] & &Z'
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{proposition}
The canonical projection \(\pi : A \to A/{\sim}\) is an initial object of the
category.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let a morphism \(\varphi: A \to Z\). The claim says that there exists a
unique morphism \(\tilde{\varphi} : A/{\sim} \to Z\) such that the diagram
commutes
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    A \ar[rr, "\varphi"] \ar[dr, swap, "\pi"]
      &
        & Z \\
      & A/{\sim} \ar[ur, swap, "\widetilde \varphi"]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
From the imposition that such diagram commutes, we are inclined to define the
morphism \(\tilde\varphi\) such that for every element \(a \in A\) it
satisfies \(\tilde\varphi(\overline{a}) = \varphi(a)\), so that
\(\tilde\varphi  \pi (a) = \varphi(a)\). Since the projection and
\(\varphi\) are essentially unique, it is clear that if \(\tilde\varphi\)
exists, then it should also be unique. We now show that we can construct the
morphism \(\tilde\varphi\). Notice that if \(\overline{a} = \overline{a'}\)
then \(\tilde\varphi(\overline{a}) = \varphi(a)= \varphi(a') =
\tilde\varphi(\overline{a'})\) thus indeed the morphism is well defined.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Products}

\begin{proposition}\label{universal property for products}
Let objects \(X, Y\) in a given category \(\cat{C}\) and projections \(\pi_X
\in \Hom(X \times Y, X)\) and \(\pi_Y \in \Hom(X \times Y, Y)\). Let any
object \(Z\) in the category and set \(\varphi \in \Hom(Z, X)\) and \(\psi
\in \Hom(Z, Y)\). Then there exists a unique morphism \(\ell \in \Hom(Z, X
\times Y)\) such that the following diagram commutes
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
      & Z
      \ar[d, dashed, "\ell"]
      \ar[ddl, bend right, swap, "\varphi"]
      \ar[ddr, bend left, "\psi"]
        & \\
      & X \times Y \ar[dl, "\pi_X"] \ar[dr, swap, "\pi_Y"] \\
    X
      &
        & Y
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
this is the so called \emph{universal property for products}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Define the morphism \(\ell(z) \coloneq (\varphi(z), \psi(z))\) for any  \(z \in
Z\), then \(\pi_X  \ell (z) = \pi_X(\varphi(z), \psi(z)) = \varphi(z)\)
and the same being true for the left branch. Notice that trivially there is a
unique mapping with such property because it need to imitate the image of
both \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: product-morphism}
Let \(\cat C\) be a category with products, and \(x \in \Hom_{\cat C}(X, Y)\).
Then there exists a unique morphism \(x \times x: X \times X \to Y \times Y\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\pi_X: X \times X \to X\), and \(\pi_Y: Y \times Y \to Y\) denote any
projection. Define a morphism \(f \in \Hom_{\cat C}(X \times X, Y)\) by \(f =
\phi \pi_X\). From \cref{universal property for products} we find that there
exists a unique morphism \(X \times X \to Y \times Y\) --- which we'll denote
by \(x \times x\) --- such that the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  X \times X \ar[d, dashed, swap, "x \times x"] \ar[dr, bend left, "f"] \\
  Y \times Y \ar[r, "\pi_Y"] &Y
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{proof}

If we consider the case for \(\Set\), we can even find a definite morphism \(x
\times x\), it is given by \((a, b) \xmapsto{x \times x} (x(a), x(b))\). In the
proof given above, however, one would need to caution that the projections
\(\pi_X\) and \(\pi_Y\) must project the same component --- if not, the diagram
would not commute in \(\Set\).

\begin{proposition}[Fibered products]
Let \(X, Y, Z\) objects of a category \(\cat C\) and morphisms \(\varphi :X
\to Z\) and \(\psi : Y \to Z\). Define \(P\) to be an object such that the
morphism  \(\pi_X : P \to X\) and  \(\pi_Y : P \to Y\) are such that, for any
morphisms \(f : L \to X\) and  \(g : L \to Y\), where \(L\) is another object
of the category \(\cat C\), there exists a unique morphism \(\ell: L \to P\)
for which the diagram commutes
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    L
    \ar[dr, dashed, "\ell"]
    \ar[drr, bend left, "g"]
    \ar[ddr, bend right, swap, "f"]
    &
      & \\
    &P
    \ar[r, "\pi_Y"]
    \ar[d, swap, "\pi_X"]
      &Y
      \ar[d, "\psi"]
      \\
    &X
    \ar[r, swap, "\varphi"]
      &Z
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
We call the object \(P\) the \emph{fiber product of \(X\) and \(Y\) over
\(Z\)}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Indeed we can construct such object \(P\), for instance, notice that firstly
the morphisms \(\varphi  \pi_X = \psi  \pi_Y\). Thus for any
given element \(p \in P\), we need \(\pi_X(p) = x \in X\) such that
\(\varphi(x) = \psi(\pi_Y(p))\), and also the converse should be true.
Therefore, we simply need to define the object \(P\) as
\[
  P \coloneq \{(a, b) \in X \times Y : \varphi(a) = \psi(b)\}
\]
and the morphisms as simply projections of such set into the respective
object \(X\) or \(Y\).

With this description, we can see that \(\ell\) should be constructed in such
a way that for any given morphism \(f, g\) shown in the diagram the following
holds: \(\pi_X  \ell = \pi_Y  \ell\) thus, it is simply necessary
to impose \(\ell(u) = (f(u), g(u))\) for all \(u \in L\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Coproduct}

Since products are seen as final objects in the category of interest, we see
coproducts (or disjoint unions) as initial objects of the category.

\begin{proposition}
Let objects \(X, Y\) in a category \(\cat C\) and let the morphisms
\(\iota_X : X \to X \amalg Y\) and \(\iota_Y : Y \to X \amalg Y\). Let now
another object \(Z\) and assume the morphisms \(\varphi : X \to Z\) and
\(\psi : Y \to Z\). Then there exists a unique morphism \(\ell : X \amalg Y
\to Z\) such that the diagram commutes:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X
    \ar[ddr, bend right, swap,  "\varphi"]
    \ar[dr, "\iota_X"]
      &
        &Y
        \ar[dl, swap, "\iota_Y"]
        \ar[ddl, bend left, "\psi"]
        \\
      &X \amalg Y
      \ar[d, dashed, "\ell"]
        &\\
      &Z
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\todo[inline]{Coproduct universal property}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
The disjoint union is a coproduct in \(\Set\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since the disjoint union of sets \(X, Y\) is said to be the union of,
respectively, isomorphic copies \(X', Y'\) we can proceed by defining \(X'
\coloneq \{0\} \times X\) and \(Y' \coloneq \{1\} \times Y\), which will do the
work for us. Next we simply define the inclusions \(\iota_X(a) \coloneq (0, a)\)
and \(\iota_Y(b) \coloneq (1, b)\) for all \(a \in X\) and \(b \in Y\). For the
final step, we define the unique function \(\ell\) as \(\ell((0,a)) \coloneq
\varphi(a) \in Z\) for \(a \in X\) and \(\ell((1, b)) \coloneq \psi(b) \in Z\)
for \(b \in Y\). All defined functions are clearly well defined and \(\ell\)
needs to be unique because it imitates the image of \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Cofibered Product]
Let objects \(X, Y, Z\) in a category \(\cat C\) and morphisms \(\varphi : Z
\to X\) and \(\psi : Z \to Y\). Let the inclusions \(\iota_A : A \to A \amalg
B\) and  \(\iota_B: B \to A \amalg B\) and define the object
\[
    P \coloneq A \amalg B / (\iota  \varphi(z) \sim \iota  \psi(z),\
    z \in Z).
\]
With maps \(j_A : A \xrightarrow{\iota_A} A \amalg B \to P\) and  \(j_B : B
\xrightarrow{\iota_B} A \amalg B \to P\). Then there exists a unique morphism
\(\ell : P \to L\) for which the diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      Z
      \ar[r, "\psi"]
      \ar[d, swap, "\varphi"]
        &Y
        \ar[d, "j_Y"]
        \ar[ddr, bend left, "g"]
          &\\
      X
      \ar[r, "j_X"]
      \ar[drr, bend right, swap, "f"]
        &P
        \ar[dr, dashed, "\ell"]
          &\\
        &
          &L
    \end{tikzcd}
\]
We call \(P\) the fiber coproduct of \(X\) and \(Y\) over \(Z\)
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Notice that we are imposing \(\ell  j_X = f\) and \(\ell  j_Y =
g\), thus

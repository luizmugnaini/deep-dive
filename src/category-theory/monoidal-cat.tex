\section{Monoidal Categories}

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:monoidal-category}
    A \emph{monoidal category} is a tuple
    \((\cat M, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)\) consisting of:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item A \emph{category} \(\cat M\).

        \item A bifunctor \(\otimes: \cat M \times \cat M \to \cat M\)

        \item A distinguished object \(1 \in \cat M\) that is \emph{unitary} with
              respect to \(\otimes\), that is:
              \[
                  m \otimes 1 = m = 1 \otimes m
              \]
              for any object \(m \in \cat M\).

        \item A \emph{natural isomorphism}
              \[
                  \alpha: (- \otimes (- \otimes -))
                  \overset{\iso}\Longrightarrow ((- \otimes -) \otimes -).
              \]
              called \emph{associator}, in the sense that given any triple of objects \((a,
              b, c)\) of \(\cat M\), the image
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      a \otimes (b \otimes c)
                      \ar[r, "{\alpha(a, b, c)}"', "\dis"]
                      &(a \otimes b) \otimes c
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              is an isomorphism in \(\cat M\).

        \item Two \emph{natural isomorphisms}
              \[
                  \lambda: (1 \otimes -)
                  \overset{\iso}\Longrightarrow (-)
                  \quad
                  \text{ and }
                  \quad
                  \rho: (- \otimes 1)
                  \overset{\iso}\Longrightarrow (-)
              \]
              called \emph{left and right unitors}, respectively. In other words, given any
              object \(a \in \cat M\) the morphisms \(\lambda a: 1 \otimes a \isoto a\) and
              \(\rho a: a \otimes 1 \isoto a\) are \emph{isomorphisms} in \(\cat M\).
    \end{itemize}
    This data should satisfy the following two conditions:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item (Triangle identity) Given any pair \((a, b)\) of objects in \(\cat M\),
              the diagram
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      a \otimes (1 \otimes b) \ar[rr, "{\alpha(a, 1, b)}"]
                      \ar[rd, "\Id_a \otimes \rho b"']
                      & &(a \otimes 1) \otimes b \ar[ld, "\lambda a \otimes \Id_b"]
                      \\
                      &a \otimes b &
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              commutes in \(\cat M\).

        \item (Pentagon identity) Given any tuple \((a, b, c, d)\) of objects in
              \(\cat M\), the diagram
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      &
                      &(a \otimes b) \otimes (c \otimes d)
                      \ar[rdd, "{\alpha(a \otimes b, c, d)}"]
                      &
                      \\
                      & & &
                      \\
                      a \otimes (b \otimes (c \otimes d))
                      \ar[dd, "{\Id_a \otimes \alpha(b, c, d)}"']
                      \ar[rruu, "{\alpha(a, b, c \otimes d)}"]
                      &
                      &
                      &((a \otimes b) \otimes c) \otimes d
                      \\
                      & & &
                      \\
                      % empty
                      a \otimes ((b \otimes c) \otimes d)
                      \ar[rrr, "{\alpha(a, b \otimes c, d)}"']
                      &
                      &
                      &(a \otimes (b \otimes c)) \otimes d
                      \ar[uu, "{\alpha(a, b, c) \otimes \Id_d}"']
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              is commutative in \(\cat M\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
The tuple \((\cat M, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)\) is said to be a
\emph{strict monoidal category} if the three natural isomorphisms are naturally
isomorphic to the identity---if this is the case, we shall refer to the category
simply by the triple \((\cat M, \otimes, 1)\).

\begin{definition}[Monoidal functor]
    \label{def:monoidal-functor}
    Let \((\cat M, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)\) and \((\cat N,
    \widehat\otimes, \widehat 1, \widehat \alpha, \widehat \lambda, \widehat \rho)\)
    be two (strict) monoidal categories. We say that a functor \(F: \cat M \to \cat
    N\) is a (\emph{strict}) \emph{monoidal functor} if it preserves the actions of
    the natural isomorphisms. To put concretely, we have:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item The unit of \(\cat M\) is mapped to the unit of \(\cat N\), that is,
              \(F e = \widehat e\).

        \item For any \(a \in \cat M\) one has
              \(F (\lambda a) = \widehat \lambda (F a)\) and
              \(F (\rho a) = \widehat \rho(F a)\).

        \item For any pair \((a, b)\) of objects in \(\cat M\) there exists an
              isomorphism \(F(a \otimes b) \iso F a \widehat \otimes F b\) in \(\cat
              N\)---in the strict case, the isomorphism is replaced by an equality.

        \item For any triple \((a, b, c)\) of objects in \(\cat M\) we have
              \(F \alpha(a, b, c) = \widehat \alpha (F a, F b, F c)\).

        \item For every two maps \(f\) and \(g\) in \(\cat M\) there exists an
              isomorphism \(F(f \otimes g) \iso F f \widehat \otimes F g\) in
              \(\cat N\)---in the strict case, the isomorphism is replaced by an equality.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Monoidal natural transformation]
    \label{def:monoidal-natural-transformation}
    Let \((\cat M, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)\) and
    \((\cat N, \widehat\otimes, \widehat 1, \widehat \alpha, \widehat \lambda,
    \widehat \rho)\) be two (strict) monoidal categories, and consider a pair of
    parallel (strict) functors \(F, G: \cat M \para \cat N\). A natural
    transformation \(\eta: F \nat G\) is said to be \emph{monoidal} if
    \(\eta_1 = \widehat 1\), and for any pair of objects \(a, b \in \cat M\) the
    diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            F(a \otimes b) \ar[d, "\dis"']
            \ar[r, "\eta_{a \otimes b}"]
            &G(a \otimes b) \ar[d, "\dis"] \\
            F a \widehat\otimes F b \ar[r, "\eta_a \widehat\otimes \eta_b"']
            &G a \widehat\otimes G b
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commutes in the monoidal category \(\cat N\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Strictification of monoidal categories]
    \label{thm:strictification-mon-cat}
    Every monoidal category is \emph{monoidally equivalent} to a \emph{strict}
    monoidal category.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let \((\cat M, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)\) be a monoidal
    category. We shall construct a strict monoidal category out of \(\cat M\). To
    that end, define a category \(\cat N\) where:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item The objects of \(\cat N\) are pairs \((F, \eta)\) where \(F\) is an
              \emph{endofunctor} of \(\cat M\) and
              \[
                  \eta: F(- \otimes -) \isonat F(-) \otimes (-)
              \]
              is a \emph{natural isomorphism} such that, for any triple \((a, b, c)\) of
              objects of \(\cat M\), the pentagonal diagram
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      &
                      &(F(a) \otimes b) \otimes c
                      &
                      \\
                      & & &
                      \\
                      F(a \otimes b) \otimes c
                      \ar[rruu, "\eta_{(a, b)} \otimes \Id_c"]
                      &
                      &
                      & F(a) \otimes (b \otimes c)
                      \ar[luu, "{\alpha(F a, b, c)}"']
                      \\
                      & & &
                      \\
                      F((a \otimes b) \otimes c)
                      \ar[uu, "\eta_{(a \otimes b, c)}"]
                      &
                      &
                      &F(a \otimes (b \otimes c))
                      \ar[lll, "{F \alpha(a, b, c)}"]
                      \ar[uu, "\eta_{(a, b \otimes c)}"']
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]

        \item A morphism \(\varepsilon: (F, \eta) \to (F', \eta')\) is a natural
              transformation \(\varepsilon: F \nat F'\) such that, given any pair \((a, b)\)
              of objects of \(\cat M\), the diagram
              \begin{equation}\label{eq:coherence-morphism-cat-N}
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      F(a \otimes b) \ar[d, "\eta_{(a, b)}"']
                      \ar[r, "\varepsilon_{a \otimes b}"]
                      &F'(a \otimes b) \ar[d, "\eta'_{(a, b)}"]
                      \\
                      F(a) \otimes b \ar[r, "\varepsilon_a \otimes \Id_b"']
                      &F'(a) \otimes b
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \end{equation}
              commutes in \(\cat M\). Moreover, we define the composition of morphisms in
              \(\cat N\) to be given by the vertical composition of natural transformations.

        \item Define a bifunctor \(\widehat\otimes: \cat N \times \cat N \to \cat N\) as
              \((F, \eta) \widehat\otimes (F', \eta') \coloneq (F F', \widehat\eta)\), where
              \[
                  \widehat\eta: F F'(- \otimes -) \nat F F'(-) \otimes (-)
              \]
              is the natural transformation given by the composition
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      F F'(a \otimes b)
                      \ar[rr, "F \eta'_{(a, b)}"']
                      \ar[rrrr, bend left, "\widehat\eta_{(a, b)}"]
                      &
                      &F (F'(a) \otimes b)
                      \ar[rr, "\eta_{(F' a, b)}"']
                      &
                      &F F'(a) \otimes b
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              for any pair of objects \((a, b)\) of \(\cat M\).
    \end{itemize}
    From this construction we find that the triple
    \((\cat N, \widehat\otimes, (\Id_{\cat M}, I))\)---where the natural
    transformation \(I: (- \otimes -) \isonat (- \otimes -)\) is the identity
    morphism \(I_{(a, b)} \coloneq \Id_{a \otimes b}\) in \(\cat M\) for any two
    \(a, b \in \cat M\)---is a \emph{strict monoidal category}, since:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item The bifunctor \(\widehat\otimes\) satisfies \emph{equality} for both left
              and right unitors: given an object \((F, \eta) \in \cat N\), consider any two
              objects \(a, b \in \cat N\) then by the definition of \((F, \eta)
              \widehat\otimes (\Id_{\cat M}, I) = (F, \widehat\eta)\) and \((\Id_{\cat M},
              I) \widehat\otimes (F, \widehat\eta')\) one has
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {F(a \otimes b)} \ar[rr, "F \Id_{a \otimes b} = \Id_{F(a \otimes b)}"']
                      \ar[rrrr, bend left, "\widehat\eta_{(a, b)}"]
                      &&{F(a \otimes b)} \ar[rr, "\eta_{(a, b)}"']
                      &&{F(a) \otimes b}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      {F(a \otimes b)} \ar[rr, "\Id_{\cat M} \eta_{(a, b)} = \eta_{(a, b)}"]
                      \ar[rrrr, bend right, "\widehat\eta'_{(a, b)}"']
                      &&{F(a) \otimes b} \ar[rr, "I_{(Fa, b)} = \Id_{F(a) \otimes b}"]
                      &&{F(a) \otimes b}
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              therefore \(\widehat\eta = \eta = \widehat\eta'\). Moreover, this also shows
              that the triangle identity is satisfied.

        \item Associativity follows from the associativity of morphisms and functors.
    \end{itemize}

    We now prove that \(\cat M\) and \(\cat N\) are equivalent categories. In order
    to do that, define a functor \(E: \cat M \to \cat N\) mapping objects
    \(a \mapsto (a \otimes (-), \alpha(a, -, -))\) and morphisms
    \(f \mapsto f \otimes (-)\). We now show that \(E\) is an equivalence of
    categories:
    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item (Essentially surjective) Notice that, given any object
              \((F, \eta) \in \cat N\), we can define a morphism
              \[
                  \varepsilon: (F 1 \otimes (-), \alpha(F1, -, -))
                  \longrightarrow (F, \eta)
              \]
              by constructing a natural transformation
              \(\varepsilon: F 1 \otimes (-) \nat F\) where
              \(\varepsilon_a \coloneq \lambda_{a} \eta_{(1, a)}^{-1}\), which is an
              isomorphism \(F(1) \otimes a \iso F a\) for any \(a \in \cat M\)---showing
              that \(\varepsilon\) is a natural isomorphism, defining an isomorphism
              \(E(F 1) \iso (F, \eta)\).

        \item (Full) Let \(a, b \in \cat M\) be any two objects, and
              \(\varepsilon: E a \to E b\) be any morphism of \(\cat N\)---that is, a
              natural transformation \(\varepsilon: (a \otimes -) \nat (b \otimes -)\)
              satisfying the coherence diagram \cref{eq:coherence-morphism-cat-N}. Define
              \(f: a \to b\) to be the morphism in \(\cat M\) given by
              \(f \coloneq (\lambda b) \circ \varepsilon_1 \circ (\lambda^{-1} a)\). By the
              definition of \(E\), one has \(E f = f \otimes (-)\)---we wish to show that
              this agrees with \(\varepsilon\). Given any \(c \in \cat M\) the diagram
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      a \otimes c \ar[rr, "{\Id_a \otimes \rho(c)^{-1}}"]
                      \ar[d, "\varepsilon_c"']
                      && a \otimes (1  \otimes c) \ar[rr, "{\alpha(a, 1, c)}"]
                      \ar[d, "\varepsilon_{e \otimes c}"']
                      \ar[rrrr, bend left=30, "{\Id_a \otimes \rho c}"]
                      && (a \otimes 1) \otimes c \ar[rr, "{\lambda a \otimes \Id_c}"]
                      \ar[d, "\varepsilon_1 \otimes \Id_c"]
                      && a \otimes c \ar[d, "f \otimes \Id_c"]
                      \\
                      b \otimes c \ar[rr, "{\Id_b \otimes \rho(c)^{-1}}"']
                      && b \otimes (1 \otimes c) \ar[rr, "{\alpha(b, 1, c)}"']
                      \ar[rrrr, bend right=30, "{\Id_b \otimes \rho c}"']
                      && (b \otimes 1) \otimes c \ar[rr, "{\lambda b \otimes \Id_c}"']
                      && b \otimes c
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              is commutative in \(\cat M\): the left and center squares commute by the
              naturallity of \(\varepsilon\), the up and down wings commute by the triangle
              identities, the right square commutes by the definition of \(f\). It follows
              from commutativity that \(\varepsilon_c = f \otimes \Id_c\), therefore
              \(E f = \varepsilon\).

        \item (Faithful) Let \(f\) and \(g\) be morphisms of \(\cat M\) such that \(E f
              = E g\), so that in particular \(f \otimes \Id_1 = g \otimes \Id_1\)---hence
              \(f = g\), proving injectivity on the morphism collections of \(\cat M\) and
              \(\cat N\).

        \item (Monoidal) First, it is clear that
              \(E 1 = (1 \otimes (-), \alpha(1, -, -)) \iso (\Id_{\cat M}, I)\). Moreover,
              for any pair of morphisms \(f\) and \(g\) of \(\cat M\) one has
              \[
                  E(f \otimes g) = (f \otimes g) \otimes (-)
                  \iso f \otimes (g \otimes -)
                  = E f \widehat\otimes E g.
              \]
              Given any two \(a, b \in \cat M\), from definition:
              \[
                  E (a \otimes b) = ((a \otimes b) \otimes (-), \alpha(a \otimes b, -, -))
                  \iso (a \otimes (b \otimes -), \alpha(a \otimes b, -, -)),
              \]
              also we know that if
              \[
                  (a \otimes (b \otimes -), \beta)
                  \coloneq (a, \alpha(a, -, -)) \widehat\otimes (b, \alpha(b, -, -))
                  = E a \widehat\otimes E b,
              \]
              then \(\beta\) is defined so that the up wing of the diagram
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      a \otimes (b \otimes (c \otimes d))
                      \ar[rr, "{a \otimes \alpha(b, c, d)}"']
                      \ar[rrrr, bend left, "\beta_{(c, d)}"]
                      \ar[d, "\alpha{(a, b, c \otimes d)}"']
                      &&a \otimes ((b \otimes c) \otimes d)
                      \ar[rr, "{\alpha(a, b \otimes c, d)}"']
                      &&(a \otimes (b \otimes c)) \otimes d
                      \ar[d, "\alpha{(a, b, c)} \otimes \Id_d"]
                      \\
                      (a \otimes b) \otimes (c \otimes d)
                      \ar[rrrr, "\alpha{(a \otimes b, c, d)}"']
                      && &&((a \otimes b) \otimes c) \otimes d
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              commutes in \(\cat M\) for any two \(c, d \in \cat M\)---the square commutes
              by the pentagon identity. This shows that
              \[
                  \alpha(a, b, -): (a \otimes (b \otimes -), \beta)
                  \isoto (a \otimes (b \otimes -), \alpha(a \otimes b, -, -))
              \]
              is an isomorphsim in \(\cat N\). Therefore
              \(E(a \otimes b) \iso E a \widehat \otimes E b\). For the left and right
              unitor isomorphisms \(E (\lambda a) \iso \widehat \lambda(E a)\) and
              \(E(\rho a) \iso \widehat \rho(E a)\) we shall simply argue that they both
              come straight from the triangle identity of \(\cat M\). Similarly,
              \[
                  E(\alpha(a, b, c)) \iso \widehat \alpha(E a, E b, E c)
              \]
              works via a reduction to the pentagon identity in \(\cat M\).
    \end{itemize}
    This proves that \(E: \cat M \to \cat N\) is indeed a monoidal equivalence of
    categories.
\end{proof}

From now on, in view of the equivalence given by
\cref{thm:strictification-mon-cat}, whenever possible we shall adress any
monoidal category as a strict monoidal category.

\begin{definition}[(Co)monoid objects in \(\Mon\)]
    \label{def:(co)monoids}
    Let \((\cat M, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)\) be a monoidal category. We
    define the following objects:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item A \emph{monoid} in \(\cat M\) is a triple \((m, \mu, \theta)\)---where
              \(m\) is an object of \(\cat M\), a bifunctor \(\mu: m \otimes m \to m\)
              refered to as a \emph{multiplication}, and a functor \(\theta: 1 \to m\)
              called \emph{unit}---such that both diagrams
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      m \otimes (m \otimes m) \ar[d, "\Id_m \otimes \mu"']

                      m \otimes m \ar[rr, "\mu"']
                      &&m
                  \end{tikzcd}

              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}

                      & m \otimes m \ar[d, "\mu"]
                      &m \otimes 1
                      \ar[l, "\Id_m \otimes \theta"']
                      \ar[ld, "\lambda"] \\
                      &m &
                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              commute in \(\cat M\). A morphism of monoids
              \(\phi: (m, \mu, \theta) \to (m', \mu', \theta')\) is a morphism
              \(\phi: m \to m'\) in \(\cat M\) satisfying
              \(\phi \mu = \mu'(\phi \otimes \phi)\), and \(\phi \theta = \theta'\). We then
              define the subcategory \(\Mon_{\cat M}\) of \(\cat M\) composed of monoidal
              objects in \(\cat M\).

        \item A \emph{comonoid} in \(\cat M\) is a triple \((c, \kappa, \sigma)\)
              \(c\) is an object of \(\cat M\), a bifunctor \(\kappa: c \to c \otimes c\)
              refered to as a \emph{comultiplication}, and a functor \(\sigma: c \to 1\)
              called \emph{counit}---such that both diagrams
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}
                      c \otimes (c \otimes c)
                      &(c \otimes c) \otimes c
                      \ar[l, "{\alpha(c, c, c)^{-1}}"']
                      &c \otimes c
                      \ar[l, "\kappa \otimes \Id_c"']
                      \\
                      c \otimes c
                      \ar[u, "\Id_c \otimes \kappa"]
                      &&c \ar[ll, "\kappa"] \ar[u, "\kappa"']
                  \end{tikzcd}

              \[

                      \ar[l, "\sigma \otimes \Id_c"']
                      \ar[r, "\Id_c \otimes \sigma"]
                      &c \otimes 1
                      \\

                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              commute in \(\cat M\). A morphism of comonoids
              \(\psi: (c, \kappa, \sigma) \to (c', \kappa', \sigma')\) is a morphism
              \(\psi: c \to c'\) in \(\cat M\) satisfying
              \(\kappa' \psi = (\psi \otimes \psi) \kappa\), and \(\sigma = \sigma'
              \psi\). We then define the subcategory \(\coMon_{\cat M}\) of \(\cat M\)
              composed of comonoidal objects in \(\cat M\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Monoid actions]
    \label{def:monoid-actions}
    Let \((\cat M, \otimes, 1)\) be a monoidal category, and
    \((m, \mu, \theta) \in \Mon_{\cat M}\). A \emph{left-action} of the monoid
    \((m, \mu, \theta)\) on an object \(a \in \cat M\) is a bifunctor
    \(\sigma: m \otimes a \to a\) such that
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            m \otimes (m \otimes a)
            \ar[r, "{\alpha(m, m, a)}"]
            \ar[d, "\Id_m \otimes \sigma"']
            &(m \otimes m) \otimes a
            \ar[r, "\mu \otimes \Id_a"]
            &m \otimes a
            \ar[d, "\sigma"']
            &1 \otimes a
            \ar[l, "\theta \otimes \Id_a"']
            \ar[ld, "\lambda"]
            \\
            m \otimes a \ar[rr, "\sigma"']
            &
            &a
            &
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commutes in \(\cat M\). Right-actions are defined analogously.

    Given any two left-actions \(\sigma: m \otimes a \to a\) and
    \(\lambda: m \otimes b \to b\), we define a \emph{morphism of left-actions}
    \(\phi: \sigma \to \lambda\) to be a morphism \(\phi: a \to b\) in \(\cat M\)
    such that
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            m \otimes a
            \ar[d, "\sigma"']
            \ar[rr, "\Id_m \otimes \phi"]
            &&m \otimes b \ar[d, "\lambda"]
            \\
            a \ar[rr, "\phi"']
            &&b
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    is a commutative diagram in \(\cat M\). With these notions we are able to define
    two categories \(\rActMon_{(\cat M, m)}\) and \(\lActMon_{(\cat M, m)}\),
    composed of right and left actions of \(m\) on objects of \(\cat M\),
    respectively, and morphisms between them.
\end{definition}

\section{Braided \& Symmetric Monoidal Categories}

\begin{definition}[Braiding]
    \label{def:braiding}
    Given a monoidal category \((\cat M, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)\), we
    define a \emph{braiding} of \(\cat M\) to be a natural isomorphism\footnote{That
        is, for any two \(a, b \in \cat M\) one has an isomorphism
        \(\gamma_{(a, b)}: a \otimes b \isoto b \otimes a\).}
    \[
        \gamma: (- \otimes -') \isonat (-' \otimes -),

    that is coherent with associativity and unitors of \(\cat M\), in the sense that
    the diagrams

    should commute for all triples \((a, b, c)\) of objects of \(\cat M\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Braided monoidal category]
    \label{def:braided-monoidal-category}
    A monoidal category \((\cat M, \otimes, 1)\) is said to be \emph{braided} if it
    is endowed with a braiding \(\gamma\). We shall denote this data shortly by
    \((\cat M, \gamma)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
    \label{cor:braiding-morphisms}
    For any given pair of morphisms \(f: a \to b\) and \(g: c \to d\) in a braided
    monoidal category \(\cat M\), we have
    \[
        (g \otimes f) \gamma_{(a, c)} \iso \gamma_{(b, d)} (f \otimes g).
    \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}[Braided monoidal functor]
    \label{def:braided-monoidal-functor}
    A monoidal functor \(F: (\cat A, \gamma) \to (\cat B, \widehat \gamma)\) between
    braided monoidal categories is said to be a \emph{braided monoidal functor} if
    for every pair of objects \(a, b \in \cat A\) the braiding coherence square
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            F a \otimes F b \ar[r, "\widehat\gamma"] \ar[d, "\dis"']

    commutes in \(\cat B\).
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
    \label{cor:composition-of-braided-monoidal-functors}
    The composition of braided monoidal functors is again a braided monoidal
    functor.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Indeed, if
    \((\cat A, \gamma) \xrightarrow F (\cat B, \widehat \gamma) \xrightarrow G (\cat
    C, \widetilde \gamma)\) are braided monoidal functors, then for every pair
    \(a, b \in \cat A\) one has the following commutative diagram in \(\cat C\):
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            G F a \otimes G F b
            \ar[r, "\widetilde \gamma"]

            \ar[d, "\dis"]
            \\
            G(F a \otimes F b)
            \ar[r, "G \widehat \gamma"]
            \ar[d, "\dis"']

\begin{definition}

    We define a category \(\BrMonCat\) composed of braided monoidal categories and
    braided monoidal functors between them.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Symmetric monoidal category]
    \label{def:symmetric-monoidal-category}
    A braided monoidal category \((\cat M, \gamma)\) is said to be \emph{symmetric}
    if for any two \(a, b \in \cat M\) the triangle
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            a \otimes b \ar[rr, "\Id_{a \otimes b}"]

        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commutes in \(\cat M\). A morphism between symmetric monoidal categories is a
    braided monoidal functor between them.

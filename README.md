# Deep Dive

This is just a poetic name to a compilation of notes that I'm writing while
studying mathematics. They currently encompass:

- Category Theory
- Linear Algebra
- Group Theory
- Ring Theory
- Module Theory
- Classical Topology
- Abstract Homotopy Theory
- Graph Theory
- Manifold Theory
- Real Analysis
- Statistics, Probability and Machine Learning

None of these subjects are completed and will never be (for trivial reasons).
I don't know why I keep these notes public, but if you happen to compile them
and find them helpful or stupid in some way (and if you're willing to help),
reach me out and I'll be quite happy to have some feedback.

For the compilation of the notes:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/luizmugnaini/deep-dive
cd deep-dive
make build  # single build
make watch  # continuous build as files are changed
```

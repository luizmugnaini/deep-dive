\section{Topology}

\begin{definition}[Topology]
  Let \(X\) be a set and \(\mathcal T \subseteq 2^X\). We say that \(\mathcal
  T\) is a topology for \(X\) if
  \begin{enumerate}[(T1)]
    \item \(X, \emptyset \in \mathcal T\).
    \item The arbitrary union of elements of \(\mathcal T\) is an element of
      \(\mathcal T\). 
    \item The finite intersection of elements of \(\mathcal T\) is an element of
      \(\mathcal T\).
  \end{enumerate}
  The elements of \(\mathcal T\) are called open sets of \(X\).
\end{definition}

\subsection{Some Examples of Topologies}

\begin{example}
  The collection \(\mathcal T_1 = \{U \subseteq X : U = \emptyset \text{ or } X
  \setminus U \text{ is finite}\}\) is the cofinite topology on \(X\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  The collection \(\mathcal T_2 = \{U \subseteq X : U = \emptyset \text{ or } X
  \setminus U \text{ is countable}\}\) is the cocountable topology on \(X\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let \(p \in X\), then \(\mathcal T_3 = \{U \subseteq X : U = \emptyset \text{
  or } p \in U\}\) is the particular point topology on \(X\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let \(p \in X\), then \(\mathcal T_4 = \{U \subseteq X : U = X \text{
  or } p \not\in U\}\) is the excluded point topology on \(X\).
\end{example}

\section{Closed and Open Sets}

\begin{definition}[Closed set]
  Let \(X\) be a topological space. We define a set \(A \subseteq X\) to be
  closed if \(X \setminus A\) is open.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space, then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The sets \(X\) and \(\emptyset\) are closed.
    \item The finite union of closed sets is closed.
    \item The arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Miscelaneous]
  Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(A \subseteq X\) be a set. We define
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{def: closure}
      The closure of \(A\) is the least closed set, \(\overline A\), that
      contains \(A\). This can be equivalently described as
      \[
        \overline A = \bigcap \{F \subseteq X : A \subseteq F \text{ and } F
        \text{ is closed}\}.
      \] 
    \item\label{def: interior}
      The interior of \(A\) is the biggest open set \(\Int(A)\) contained in
      \(A\). That is 
       \[
         \Int(A) = \bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \subseteq A, U \text{ is open}\}.
      \] 
    \item\label{def: exterior}
      The exterior of \(A\) in \(X\) is defined as
      \[
        \Ext(A) = X \setminus \overline A.
      \] 
    \item\label{def: boundary}
      The boundary of \(A\) in \(X\) is defined as
      \[
        \partial A = X \setminus (\Int(A) \cup \Ext(A)).
      \] 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: closure equivalent prop}
  Let \(A \subseteq X\) be a subset of the topological space \(X\). The
  following propositions are equivalent
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item \(x \in \overline A\).
    \item Every neighbourhood \(U \subseteq X\) of \(x\) is such that \(U
      \cap A \neq \emptyset\).
    \item There exists a base \(\mathcal B_x\) at the point \(x\) (see
      \cref{def: basis at a point}) such that for all \(U \in \mathcal B_x\) we
      have \(U \cap A = \emptyset\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  (i \(\Rightarrow\) ii) Let \(x \in X\) and suppose that ii is false for \(x\),
  so that \(\exists U \subseteq X\) neighbourhood of \(x\) such that \(U \cap A
  = \emptyset\). Then \(A \subseteq X \setminus U\), that is, \(A\) is a subset
  of the complement of \(U\). Since \(U\) is open, then \(X \setminus U \in C_A
  := \{F \subseteq X : A \subseteq F,\ F \text{ is closed}\}\). From the
  definition of closure, we have that \(\overline A \subseteq X \setminus U\)
  and therefore \(x \not\in \overline A\). (ii \(\Rightarrow\) iii) From the
  definition of a base at the point \(x\), we know that every \(U \in \mathcal
  B_x\) is a neighbourhood of \(x\), hence if ii is true for \(x\), proposition
  iii follows immediately. (\(\text{iii} \Rightarrow \text i\)) Let \(x \in X\)
  such that \(x \not\in \overline A\), so that proposition i is false for \(x\).
  From the definition of closure, there exists \(F \subseteq C_A\) such that \(x
  \not\in F\). Consider the open complement \(V = X \setminus F\) so that \(x
  \in V\) and \(V \cap A = \emptyset\). Hence, given any base at \(x\) there
  exists a neighbourhood of \(x\), say \(U\), such that \(U \subseteq V\) and
  hence \(U \cap A = \emptyset\), which implies that proposition iii is false
  for \(x\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor: disjoint closure persistence}
  If \(U\) is an open set and \(U \cap A = \emptyset\), then \(U \cap \overline
  A = \emptyset\). Also, if \(U\) and \(V\) are disjoint sets, then \(U \cap
  \overline V = \overline U \cap V = \emptyset\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose \(U \cap A = \emptyset\) and that there exists \(x \in U \cap
  \overline A\), so that \(x \in \overline A\). Since \(U\) is open, it
  is a neighbourhood of \(x\), hence from \cref{prop: closure equivalent prop}
  we find that \(U \cap A \neq \emptyset\), which is false, thus \(U \cap
  \overline A = \emptyset\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: open set nbhd criterion}
  Let be \(X\) a topological space and \(A \subseteq X\) be a subset. A point
  \(x \in \Int(A)\) if and only if there exists a neighbourhood \(U \subseteq
  X\) of \(x\) such that \(U \subseteq A\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(x \in A\) be any point. Suppose \(\exists U \subseteq X\) neighbourhood
  of \(x\) such that \(U \subseteq A\), then from the fact that \(U\) is open we
  conclude that \(U \subseteq \Int(A)\) from the definition of the interior
  operator. Suppose \(x \in \Int A = \bigcup \{U \subseteq A : U \text{ is
  open}\}\) then there exists \(U \subseteq A\) open such that \(x \in U\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(A \subseteq X\). Then \(\overline{X
  \setminus A} = X \setminus \Int(A)\) and also \(\Int(X \setminus A) =
  X \setminus \overline A\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We prove the first equality. Let \(\mathcal A := \{U \subseteq A : U \text{ is
  open}\}\), from definition we have that \(\Int(A) = \bigcup_{U \in \mathcal A}
  U\), moreover, \(X \setminus \Int(A) = X \setminus \bigcup_{U \in \mathcal A}
  U = \bigcap_{U \in \mathcal A} X \setminus U\) from de Morgan's Laws. Notice
  that obviously \(X \setminus U \subseteq X\) and moreover since \(U\) is open,
  then the complement \(X \setminus U\) is closed. This makes \(X \setminus
  \Int(A) = \bigcap_{U \in \mathcal A} X \setminus U = \overline{X \setminus
  A}\). Now we show the second equality. Define \(\mathcal{\widetilde A} := \{U
  \subseteq A : U \text{ is closed}\}\), then \(\overline A = \bigcap_{U \in
  \mathcal{\widetilde A}} U\) and hence \(X \setminus \overline A = X \setminus
  \bigcap_{U \in \mathcal{\widetilde A}} U = \bigcup_{U \in \mathcal{\widetilde
  A}} X \setminus U\). Notice that \(X\setminus U \subseteq X \setminus A\) and
  since \(U\) is closed, then \(X \setminus U\) is open. From this we conclude
  that \(X \setminus \overline A = \bigcup_{U \in \mathcal{\widetilde A}} X
  \setminus U = \Int(X \setminus A)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: finite union of closures}
  Let a finite collection of subsets \(\{A_i\}_{i = 1}^n \subseteq 2^X\), where
  \(X\) is a topological space, then we have that
  \[
    \overline{\bigcup_{i = 0}^n A_i} = \bigcup_{i = 0}^n \overline{A_i}.
  \] 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to prove that for \(A, B \subseteq X\) we have \(\overline{A \cup
  B} = \overline A \cup \overline B\). Notice that \(\overline A,
  \overline B \subseteq \overline{A \cup B}\), hence \(\overline A \cup
  \overline B \subseteq \overline{A \cup B}\). Now, since \(A \subseteq
  \overline A\) and \(B \subseteq \overline B\), we find \(A \cup B \subseteq
  \overline A \cup \overline B\), then \(\overline{A \cup B} \subseteq
  \overline{\overline A \cup \overline B} = \overline A \cup \overline B\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Locally finite family]
  A collection of subsets \(\{A_i\}_{i \in I} \subseteq 2^X\) of a topological
  space \(X\) is said to be a locally finite family if for every point \(x\)
  there exists a neighbourhood \(U \subseteq X\) for which the collection \(\{i
  \in I: U \cap A_i \neq \emptyset\}\) is finite.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Discrete family]
  A collection of subsets \(\{A_i\}_{i \in I} \subseteq 2^X\) of a topological
  space \(X\) is said to be a discrete family if for all \(x \in X\) there
  exists a neighbourhood \(U \subseteq X\) such that there exists at most one
  \(A_i\) in the family such that \(U \cap A \neq \emptyset\). A discrete family
  is also a locally finite family.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Given a locally finite family of sets \(\{A_i\}_{i \in I} \subseteq 2^X\),
  where \(X\) is a topological space, we have that
  \[
    \overline{\bigcup_{i \in  I} A_i} = \bigcup_{i \in  I} \overline{A_i}.
  \] 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Notice that clearly \(A_i \subseteq \overline{\bigcup_{i \in  I} A_i}\) for
  all \(i \in I\), hence \(\bigcup_{i \in  I} \overline{A_i} \subseteq
  \overline{\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i}\). Moreover, we have from hypothesis that
  \(\{A_i\}_{i \in I}\) is a locally finite family, thus given \(x \in
  \overline{\bigcup_{i \in  I} A_i}\) we can find a neighbourhood of \(x\), say
  \(U \subset X\), such that \(I_0 := \{i \in I : U \cap A_i \neq \emptyset\}\) 
  is finite. Notice that from \cref{prop: closure equivalent prop} we have that
  \(x\) cannot be a limit point of any of the sets with index \(i \in I
  \setminus I_0\), hence \(x \not\in \overline{\bigcup_{i \in  I \setminus I_0}
  A_i}\). On the other hand, we have \(x \in \overline{\bigcup_{i \in  I} A_i} =
  \overline{\bigcup_{i \in  I_0} A_i} \cup \overline{\bigcup_{i \in  I \setminus
  I_0} A_i}\), which implies that \(x \in \overline{\bigcup_{i \in  I_0} A_i} =
  \bigcup_{i \in  I_0} \overline{A_i} \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in  I}
  \overline{A_i}\) (the equality comes from the fact that \(I_0\) is finite and
  hence \cref{prop: finite union of closures} hold).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  If \(\{A_i\}_{i \in I}\) is a locally finite (resp. discrete) family, then the
  family \(\{\overline{A_i}\}_{i \in I}\) is locally finite (resp. discrete).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let the locally finite (resp. discrete) family \(\{A_i\}_{i \in I}\). Given
  any element \(x \in X\) and a neighbourhood \(U\) of \(x\) such that the
  indexing set \(I_0 := \{i \in I: U \cap A_i \neq \emptyset\}\) is finite
  (resp. is either empty or a singleton). Notice that since \(U \cap A_i
  \subseteq U \cap \overline{A_i}\), we find that \(\forall i \in I_0, U \cap
  \overline{A_i} \neq \emptyset\), so that \(I_0 = I_0' := \{i \in I: U \cap
  \overline{A_i} \neq \emptyset\}\). Since \(U\) is an open set, from \cref{cor:
  disjoint closure persistence} we find that \(U \cap \overline{A_i} = U \cap
  A_i = \emptyset\) for all \(i \in I \setminus I_0\). Which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

# Algebra Notes

These are my self-study algebra notes, currently they encompass:
* Category Theory
* Linear Algebra
* Group Theory
None of these subjects are completed (for obvious reasons). I don't know why I
keep these notes public, but if you happen to compile them and find them helpful
or stupid in some way (and if you're willing to help), reach me out and I'll be
quite happy to have some feedback.

To view the pdf of the notes you may have to
```
$ git clone https://github.com/luizmugnaini/algebra
$ cd algebra
$ pdflatex main.tex
```
